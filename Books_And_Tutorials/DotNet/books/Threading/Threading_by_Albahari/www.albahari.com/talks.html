	<p><a href="http://yowconference.com.au/">YOW 2013: Solving the Hard Problem of Concurrency</a><br />
	Concurrency is notorious for creating complexity. I argue that the blame lies not with multithreading, mutability, or even shared writable state.
	The problem is one of separation: an inability to isolate concurrency logic from application logic. 5 December (Melbourne), 9 December (Brisbane), 12 December (Sydney)
	</p>

	<p><a href="http://yowconference.com.au/">YOW 2013: A Workshop for C# Timelords</a><br />
	Join Joe Albahari, author of LINQPad and C# 5.0 in a Nutshell, on mastering the time dimension in C# with asynchronous functions and Reactive Extensions.
	3 December (Sydney), 4 December (Melbourne), 11 December (Brisbane)

	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZCzG2I8Hds">YOW Nights 2013: Programming With Purity</a><br />
		We take for granted that the goto statement is bad. Instead, we employ alternatives that make our code easier to understand and reason over, 
		namely structured looping constructs such as while-loops and for-loops. But have you ever considered that functional programmers look down on our
		 looping constructs (or more specifically, our impure use of variables) in the same way we look down on goto? And they've got a point. By avoiding 
		some of our most time-honoured tricks, we can end up with code that's not only easier to understand and reason over, but that scales better.
		October 2013, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne.

	<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/teched/default.aspx">TechEd 2013: Becoming a C# Time Lord</a><br />
	Join me in a genuine 400-level talk at TechEd 2013 for programmers and architects on how to program time with asynchronous functions and Reactive Extensions.
	3-6 September, 2013, Gold Coast.
	</p>
	
	<p><a href="http://perthdotnet.blogspot.com.au/2013/07/august-meeting-four-laws-of-time-with.html">The Four Laws of Time</a><br />
		You've heard, time and again, that multithreaded programming is impossibly difficult. I'm going to tell you that everything you've heard is wrong: 
		concurrency itself is reasonably easy. The complexity arises from allowing concurrency logic to mix with application and business logic.
		And from confusing time-based concerns with concurrency-based concerns. Solving this properly requires a new way of thinking about time, 
		concurrency and space. We need to treat time as a dimension in its own right and embrace the Four Laws of Time. Join us as we hop into the 
		Tardis and take a time-centric look at C#, asynchronous functions and Reactive Extensions. 1 August 2013, Perth.
	</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.dddmelbourne.com/">Keynote, DDD Melbourne: Programming Over Space and Time</a><br />
	Programming evolves through the creation of new abstractions, allowing us to more cleanly express intent while avoiding complexity,
	duplication and plumbing code. Yet most of the techniques and patterns in use today assume that the data we need is already there, 
	spread out over space rather than time. With the rapid growth of interconnected systems, we can no longer afford to treat latency as
	an afterthought, creating warts in our otherwise clean designs. Instead, we need to flip our perspective and embrace time as a 
	first-class concept. In this keynote, we'll make this perspective shift, leading naturally to an understanding of C#'s asynchronous
	functions, Reactive Extensions, and the art of programming over both space and time. 20 July, 2013, Melbourne.
	</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.dddmelbourne.com/">Workshop, DDD Melbourne: Hands-on Concurrency Lab</a><br />
	Explore C# 5's asynchronous functions and Reactive Extensions interactively in LINQPad. This is a chance for some hands-on concurrency programming,
	as well as an opportunity to discover more about using LINQPad as an exploration and development tool. 20 July, 2013, Melbourne.

	<p><a href="http://www.zquad.in/2012/10/azure-user-group-meeting-04th-oct-2012.html">Asynchronous Programming in C# 5</a><br />

	Ever struggled writing or debugging multithreaded code? Join Joe Albahari, author of C# 5 in a Nutshell, in Singapore for a practical session
	 on how to write responsive applications in C# 5 without resorting to threads, locks or BackgroundWorker. We'll explore the theory as well
	 as the practice behind C# 5's new asynchronous functions, and see why the old-school approach is not only hard work, but fundamentally broken.
	 We'll also touch on Reactive Framework, and they'll be a question-and-answer session on all aspects of C# 5, asynchrony and multithreading.
	4th October 2012, Singapore.</p>
	
	<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/YOW-2011-Joe-Albahari-LINQ-LINQPad-and-NET-Async">Channel 9 Interview</a><br />

	<p><a href="http://yowaustralia.com.au/YOW2011/general/details.html?speakerId=2498">YOW 2011: Asynchrony in C# 5</a><br />
	With asynchrony the central theme of both C# 5 and Microsoft's upcoming .NET Framework, the question arises, what exactly is asynchrony? And why is it suddenly so important? This session will answer those questions in detail and then take a deep dive with practical examples demonstrating how to put this exciting new technology to work in C# 5.
	We'll cover the relationship between asynchrony and multithreading, imperative vs. functional asynchrony (aka Reactive Framework), the importance of hygiene in the thread pool, and most importantly... continuations! You'll see how C# 5's language support for asynchronous continuations makes it as easy as writing one line of code after the other
	 - and why this is so important in simplifying the development of responsive and performant systems in today's interconnected world. 
	November, 2011 (Melbourne) + December 2011 (Brisbane)

		With Moore&#39;s Law forced onto a new path of increased core counts, we must multithread to make our desktop applications run faster.
		But there&#39;s a problem: the current .NET multithreading APIs are simply not up to the job. Microsoft&#39;s upcoming technology preview promises 
		to address this through two new APIs: the Task Parallel Library and Parallel LINQ. In this session, we&#39;ll demonstrate both technologies, and discuss
		what it means to think of LINQ queries as functional programming islands. Finally, we&#39;ll look at their relative performance, and how well they
		transcend the hard problems of thread safety.
