(*) type casting
-----------------

(1) lexical_cast     : converts string to integer.
(2) numeric_cast     : converts integer to string.
(3) polymorphic_cast : wrapper over dynamic cast . check the object is not null and does dynamic_cast .

(*) bind
--------
bind: bind the fundtion and parameters and returns functors. Used while passing function as parameter.

(*) lambda
----------
labda expression: passing lamda expression as parameter.

(*) Any
-------

(*) Array
---------

(*) Smartpointers: Handles deallocation and exception.
-------------------

(1) scoped_ptr    : scope ptr similar to auto_ptr without transfer of ownership.
(2) shared_ptr    : multiple pointers can share a memory resource. Internally uses reference couting.
(3) intrusive_ptr : similar to shared_ptr only difference is that reference counting need to be handled explicitly by user i.e. user can have custom refrence counting.
(4) weak_ptr      : to eliminate issue related to acyclic refrence when shared_ptr are used. 

(5) auto_ptr (stl)
