[TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]

* ~auto_ptr~:
**    Issues: 
        * implicit transfer of ownership. Which makes this confusing and dangerous if not handles properly.         

* ~scoped_ptr~:
        * explicit transfer if ownership.

* ~unique_ptr~:

* ~shared_ptr~:
        * Multiple pointer can share the same object.
        * automatic reference counting.
**      Issue:
        * *cyclic reference:* in case of cyclic refrence both the shared pointers which are refering each other will not be deallocated. 
* ~intrusive_ptr~:
        * Shared pointer where custom reference counting is maintained by the user.
* ~weak_ptr~:
        * acquire shared pointer when required else just do not refer it.
