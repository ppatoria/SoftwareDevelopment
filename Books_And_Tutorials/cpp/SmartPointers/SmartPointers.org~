Smart Pointers
---------------
(1) auto_ptr:
    Issues: 
        (*) implicit transfer of ownership. Which makes this confusing
        and dangerous if not handles properly.         

(2) scoped_ptr:
        (*) explicit transfer if ownership.

(3) unique_ptr:

(4) shared_ptr:
        (*) Multiple pointer can share the same object.
        (*) automatic reference counting.
        Issue:
                cyclic reference: in case of cyclic refrence both the
                shared pointers which are refering each other will not be deallocated. 
(5) intrusive_ptr
        (*) Shared pointer where custom reference counting is
            maintained by the user.
(6) weak_ptr:
        (*) acquire shared pointer when required else just do not
            refer it.
