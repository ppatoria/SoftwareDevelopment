<h2 id="proper-inheritance">Inheritance &#8212; Proper Inheritance and Substitutability</h2>

<h3 id="hiding-inherited-public">Should I hide member functions that were public in my base class?</h3>

<p>Never, never, never do this. Never. <em>Never!</em></p>

<p>Attempting to hide (eliminate, revoke, privatize) inherited <code>public</code> member functions is an all-too-common design
error. It usually stems from muddy thinking.</p>

<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <code>public</code> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html" title="Section: Inheritance — private and protected inheritance"><code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> inheritance</a> are
different.)</p>

<h3 id="derivedptrptr-to-baseptrptr">Converting <code>Derived*</code> → <code>Base*</code> works okay; why doesn&#8217;t <code>Derived**</code> → <code>Base**</code> work?</h3>

<p>Because converting <code>Derived**</code> → <code>Base**</code> would be invalid and dangerous.</p>

<p>C++ allows the conversion <code>Derived*</code> → <code>Base*</code>, since a <code>Derived</code> object is a kind of a <code>Base</code> object. However trying
to convert <code>Derived**</code> → <code>Base**</code> is flagged as an error. Although this error may not be obvious, it is nonetheless a
good thing. For example, if you could convert <code>Car**</code> → <code>Vehicle**</code>, and if you could similarly convert
<code>NuclearSubmarine**</code> → <code>Vehicle**</code>, you could assign those two pointers and end up making a <code>Car*</code> point at a
<code>NuclearSubmarine</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Vehicle {
public:
  virtual ~Vehicle() { }
  virtual void startEngine() = 0;
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
  virtual void startEngine();
  virtual void openGasCap();
};

class NuclearSubmarine : public Vehicle {
public:
  virtual void startEngine();
  virtual void fireNuclearMissle();
};

int main()
{
  Car   car;
  Car*  carPtr = &amp;car;
  Car** carPtrPtr = &amp;carPtr;
  Vehicle** vehiclePtrPtr = carPtrPtr;  // This is an error in C++
  NuclearSubmarine  sub;
  NuclearSubmarine* subPtr = &amp;sub;
  *vehiclePtrPtr = subPtr;
  // This last line would have caused carPtr to point to sub !
  carPtr-&gt;openGasCap();  // This might call fireNuclearMissle()!
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, if it were legal to convert <code>Derived**</code> → <code>Base**</code>, the <code>Base**</code> could be dereferenced (yielding a
<code>Base*</code>), and the <code>Base*</code> could be made to point to an object of a <em>different</em> derived class, which could cause serious
problems for national security (who knows what would happen if you invoked the <code>openGasCap()</code> member function on what
you thought was a <code>Car</code>, but in reality it was a <code>NuclearSubmarine</code>!!). Try the above code out and see what it does &#8212;
on most compilers it will call <code>NuclearSubmarine::fireNuclearMissle()</code>!</p>

<p>(BTW you&#8217;ll need to use a pointer cast to get it to compile. Suggestion: try to compile it without a pointer cast to
see what the compiler does. If you&#8217;re really quiet when the error message appears on the screen, you should be able to
hear the muffled voice of your compiler pleading with you, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t use a pointer cast! Pointer casts prevent me
from telling you about errors in your code, but they don&#8217;t make your errors go away! Pointer casts are
<a href="coding-standards.html#pointer-casts" title="FAQ: Why do people worry so much about pointer casts and/or reference casts?">evil</a>!&#8221; At least that&#8217;s what my compiler says.)</p>

<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <code>public</code> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html" title="Section: Inheritance — private and protected inheritance"><code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> inheritance</a> are
different.)</p>

<p>(Note: there is a conceptual similarity between this and <a href="const-correctness.html#constptrptr-conversion" title="FAQ: Why am I getting an error converting a Foo** → const Foo**?">the prohibition against converting <code>Foo**</code> to
<code>const Foo**</code></a>.)</p>

<h3 id="parkinglot-of-car-vs-vehicle">Is a parking-lot-of-<code>Car</code> a kind-of parking-lot-of-<code>Vehicle</code>?</h3>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>I know it sounds strange, but it&#8217;s true. You can think of this as a direct consequence of <a href="proper-inheritance.html#derivedptrptr-to-baseptrptr" title="FAQ: Converting Derived* → Base* works okay; why doesn't Derived** → Base** work?">the previous
FAQ</a>, or you can reason it this way: if the kind-of relationship were valid, then someone
could point a parking-lot-of-<code>Vehicle</code> pointer at a parking-lot-of-<code>Car</code>, which would allow someone to add <em>any</em>
kind of <code>Vehicle</code> to a parking-lot-of-<code>Car</code> (assuming parking-lot-of-<code>Vehicle</code> has a member function like
<code>add(Vehicle&amp;)</code>). In other words, you could park a <code>Bicycle</code>, <code>SpaceShuttle</code>, or even a <code>NuclearSubmarine</code> in a
parking-lot-of-<code>Car</code>. Certainly it would be surprising if someone accessed what they thought was a <code>Car</code> from the
parking-lot-of-<code>Car</code>, only to find that it is actually a <code>NuclearSubmarine</code>. Gee, I wonder what the <code>openGasCap()</code>
method would do??</p>

<p>Perhaps this will help: a container of <code>Thing</code> is <em>not</em> a kind-of container of <code>Anything</code> even if a <code>Thing</code> is a
kind-of an <code>Anything</code>. Swallow hard; it&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to like it. But you do have to accept it.</p>

<p>One last example which we use in our OO/C++ training courses: &#8220;A <code>Bag</code>-of-<code>Apple</code> is <em>not</em> a kind-of
<code>Bag</code>-of-<code>Fruit</code>.&#8221; If a <code>Bag</code>-of-<code>Apple</code> <em>could</em> be passed as a <code>Bag</code>-of-<code>Fruit</code>, someone could put a <code>Banana</code>
into the <code>Bag</code>, even though it is supposed to only contain <code>Apple</code>s!</p>

<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <code>public</code> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html" title="Section: Inheritance — private and protected inheritance"><code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> inheritance</a> are
different.)</p>

<h3 id="array-derived-vs-base">Is an array of <code>Derived</code> a kind-of array of <code>Base</code>?</h3>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>This is a corollary of the previous FAQ. Unfortunately this one can get you into a <em>lot</em> of hot water. Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>class Base {
public:
  virtual void f();             // 1
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  // ...
private:
  int i_;                       // 2
};

void userCode(Base* arrayOfBase)
{
  arrayOfBase[1].f();           // 3
}

int main()
{
  Derived arrayOfDerived[10];   // 4
  userCode(arrayOfDerived);     // 5
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler thinks this is perfectly type-safe. Line 5 converts a <code>Derived*</code> to a <code>Base*</code>. But in reality it is
horrendously evil: since <code>Derived</code> is larger than <code>Base</code>, the pointer arithmetic done on line 3 is incorrect: the
compiler uses <code>sizeof(Base)</code> when computing the address for <code>arrayOfBase[1]</code>, yet the array is an array of <code>Derived</code>,
which means the address computed on line 3 (and the subsequent invocation of member function <code>f()</code>) isn&#8217;t even at the
beginning of any object! It&#8217;s smack in the middle of a <code>Derived</code> object. Assuming your compiler uses the usual approach
to <a href="virtual-functions.html" title="Section: Inheritance — virtual functions"><code>virtual</code></a> functions, this will reinterpret the <code>int i_</code> of the first <code>Derived</code> as if it pointed
to a virtual table, it will follow that &#8220;pointer&#8221; (which at this point means we&#8217;re digging stuff out of a random memory
location), and grab one of the first few words of memory at that location and interpret them as if they were the address
of a C++ member function, then load that (random memory location) into the instruction pointer and begin grabbing
machine instructions from that memory location. The chances of this crashing are very high.</p>

<p>The root problem is that C++ can&#8217;t distinguish between a pointer-to-a-thing and a
pointer-to-an-array-of-things. Naturally C++ &#8220;inherited&#8221; this feature from C.</p>

<p>NOTE: If we had used an array class (e.g., <code>std::array&lt;Derived, 10&gt;</code> from <a href="class-libraries.html#stl" title="FAQ: What is the 'STL'?">the standard library</a>) instead of using a raw array, this problem would have been properly trapped as an error at compile time rather than a run-time disaster.</p>

<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <code>public</code> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html" title="Section: Inheritance — private and protected inheritance"><code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> inheritance</a> are different.)</p>

<h3 id="arrays-are-covariant">Does array-of-<code>Derived</code> is-<em>not</em>-a-kind-of array-of-<code>Base</code> mean arrays are bad?</h3>

<p>Yes, <a href="containers.html#arrays-are-evil" title="FAQ: Why should I use container classes rather than simple arrays?">arrays are evil</a>. (only half kidding).</p>

<p>Seriously, arrays are very closely related to pointers, and pointers are notoriously difficult to deal with. But if you have a complete grasp of why the above few FAQs were a problem from a design perspective (e.g., if you really know why a container of <code>Thing</code> is not a kind-of container of <code>Anything</code>), and if you think everyone else who will be maintaining your code also has a full grasp on these OO design truths, then you should feel free to use arrays. But if you&#8217;re like most people, you should use a template container class such as <code>std::array&lt;T, N&gt;</code> from <a href="class-libraries.html#stl" title="FAQ: What is the 'STL'?">the standard library</a> rather than fixed size raw arrays.</p>

<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <code>public</code> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html" title="Section: Inheritance — private and protected inheritance"><code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> inheritance</a> are different.)</p>

<h3 id="circle-ellipse">Is a <code>Circle</code> a kind-of an <code>Ellipse</code>?</h3>

<p>Depends. But not if <code>Ellipse</code> guarantees it can change its size asymmetrically.</p>

<p>For example, if <code>Ellipse</code> has a <code>setSize(x,y)</code> member function that promises the object&#8217;s <code>width()</code> will be <code>x</code> and its <code>height()</code> will be <code>y</code>, <code>Circle</code> can&#8217;t be a kind-of <code>Ellipse</code>. Simply put, if <code>Ellipse</code> can do something <code>Circle</code> can&#8217;t, then <code>Circle</code> can&#8217;t be a kind of <code>Ellipse</code>.</p>

<p>This leaves two valid relationships between <code>Circle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make <code>Circle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code> completely unrelated classes</li>
<li>Derive <code>Circle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code> from a base class representing &#8220;Ellipses that can&#8217;t <em>necessarily</em> perform an unequal-<code>setSize()</code> operation&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first case, Ellipse could be derived from <code>class</code> <code>AsymmetricShape</code>, and <code>setSize(x,y)</code> could be introduced in <code>AsymmetricShape</code>. However <code>Circle</code> could be derived from <code>SymmetricShape</code> which has a <code>setSize(size)</code> member function.</p>

<p>In the second case, <code>class</code> <code>Oval</code> could only have <code>setSize(size)</code> which sets both the <code>width()</code> and the <code>height()</code> to <code>size</code>. <code>Ellipse</code> and <code>Circle</code> could both inherit from <code>Oval</code>. <code>Ellipse</code> &#8212;but not <code>Circle</code>&#8212; could add the <code>setSize(x,y)</code> operation (but beware of the <a href="strange-inheritance.html#hiding-rule" title="FAQ: What's the meaning of, Warning: Derived::f(char) hides Base::f(double)?">hiding rule</a> if the same member function name <code>setSize()</code> is used for both operations).</p>

Depending on your goals, it may be okay to prevent users from changing the dimensions of an <code>Ellipse</code>, in which case it would be a valid design choice to not have a <code>setSize(x,y)</code> method in <code>Ellipse</code>.

<h3 id="circle-ellipse-options">Are there other options to the &#8220;<code>Circle</code> is/isnot kind-of <code>Ellipse</code>&#8221; dilemma?</h3>

<p>If you claim that all <code>Ellipse</code>s can be squashed asymmetrically, and you claim that <code>Circle</code> is a kind-of <code>Ellipse</code>,
and you claim that <code>Circle</code> can&#8217;t be squashed asymmetrically, clearly you&#8217;ve got to revoke one of your claims. You can
get rid of <code>Ellipse::setSize(x,y)</code>, get rid of the inheritance relationship between <code>Circle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code>, or admit
that your <code>Circle</code>s aren&#8217;t necessarily circular. You can also get rid of <code>Circle</code> completely, where circleness is just a
temporary state of an <code>Ellipse</code> object rather than a permanent quality of the object.</p>

<p>Here are the two most common traps new OO/C++ programmers regularly fall into. They attempt to use coding hacks to
cover up a broken design, e.g., they might redefine <code>Circle::setSize(x,y)</code> to throw an exception, call <code>abort()</code>, choose
the average of the two parameters, or to be a no-op. Unfortunately all these hacks will surprise users, since users are
expecting <code>width() == x</code> and <code>height() == y</code>. The one thing you must not do is surprise your users.</p>

<p>If it is important to you to retain the &#8220;<code>Circle</code> is a kind-of <code>Ellipse</code>&#8221; inheritance relationship, you can weaken the
promise made by <code>Ellipse</code>&#8217;s <code>setSize(x,y)</code>. E.g., you could change the promise to, &#8220;This member function <em>might</em> set
<code>width()</code> to <code>x</code> and/or it <em>might</em> set <code>height()</code> to <code>y</code>, or it might do <em>nothing</em>&#8221;. Unfortunately this dilutes the
contract into dribble, since the user can&#8217;t rely on any meaningful behavior. The whole hierarchy therefore begins to be
worthless (it&#8217;s hard to convince someone to use an object if you have to shrug your shoulders when asked what the object
does for them).</p>

<h3 id="circle-ellipse-nonintuitive">But I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics, and I&#8217;m <em>sure</em> a Circle is a kind of an Ellipse! Does this mean Marshall Cline is stupid? Or that C++ is stupid? Or that OO is stupid?</h3>

<p>Actually, it doesn&#8217;t mean any of these things. But I&#8217;ll tell you what it does mean &#8212; you may not like what I&#8217;m about
to say: it means your intuitive notion of &#8220;kind of&#8221; is leading you to make bad inheritance decisions. Your tummy is
lying to you about what good inheritance really means &#8212; stop believing those lies.</p>

<p>Look, I have received and answered dozens of passionate e-mail messages about this subject. I have taught it hundreds
of times to thousands of software professionals all over the place. I know it goes against your intuition. But trust me;
your intuition is wrong, where &#8220;wrong&#8221; means &#8220;will cause you to make bad inheritance decisions in OO
design/programming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how to make good inheritance decisions in OO design/programming: recognize that the derived class objects must
be <em>substitutable</em> for the base class objects. That means objects of the derived class must <em>behave</em> in a manner
consistent with the promises made in the base class&#8217; contract. Once you believe this, and I fully recognize that you
might not yet but you will if you work at it with an open mind, you&#8217;ll see that <code>setSize(x,y)</code> violates this
substitutability.</p>

<p>There are three ways to fix this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Soften the promises made by <code>setSize(x,y)</code> in base class <code>Ellipse</code>, or perhaps remove that method completely, at the
risk of breaking existing code that calls <code>setSize(x,y)</code>.</li>
<li>Strengthen the promises made by <code>setSize(x,y)</code> in the derived class <code>Circle</code>, which really means allowing a <code>Circle</code>
to have a different height than width &#8212; an asymmetrical circle; hmmm.</li>
<li>Drop the inheritance relationship, possibly getting rid of class <code>Circle</code> completely (in which case circleness would
simply be a temporary state of an <code>Ellipse</code> rather than a permanent constraint on the object).</li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry, but there simply are no other choices.</p>

<p>You must make the base class weaker (weaken <code>Ellipse</code> to the point that it no longer guarantees you can set its width
and height to different values), make the derived class stronger (empower a <code>Circle</code> with the ability to be both
symmetric and, ahem, asymmetric), or admit that a <code>Circle</code> is not substitutable for <code>Ellipse</code>.</p>

<p>Important: there really are no other choices than the above three. In particular:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>PLEASE</em> don&#8217;t write me and tell me that a fourth option is to derive both <code>Circle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code> from a third
common base class. That&#8217;s <em>not</em> a fourth solution. That&#8217;s just a repackaging of solution #3: it works precisely
because it removes the inheritance relationship between <code>Circle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code>.</li>
<li><em>PLEASE</em> don&#8217;t write me and tell me that a fourth option is to prevent users from changing the dimensions of an
&#8220;Ellipse.&#8221; That is <em>not</em> a fourth solution. That&#8217;s just a repackaging of solution #1: it works precisely because it
removes that guarantee that <code>setSize(x,y)</code> actually sets the width and height.</li>
<li><em>PLEASE</em> don&#8217;t write me and tell me that you&#8217;ve decided one of these three is &#8220;the best&#8221; solution. Doing that would
show you had missed the whole point of this FAQ, specifically that bad inheritance is subtle but fortunately you
have three (not one; not two; but three) possible ways to dig yourself out. So when you run into bad inheritance,
please try all three of these techniques and select the best, perhaps <a href="big-picture.html#use-evil-things-sometimes" title="FAQ: Will I sometimes use any so-called 'evil' constructs?">&#8220;least bad,&#8221;</a> of
the three. Don&#8217;t throw out two of these tools ahead of time: try them all.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <code>public</code> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html" title="Section: Inheritance — private and protected inheritance"><code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> inheritance</a> are
different.)</p>

<p>(Note: some people correctly point out that a <em>constant</em> <code>Circle</code> is substitutable for a <em>constant</em> <code>Ellipse</code>. That&#8217;s
true, but it&#8217;s really not a fourth option: it&#8217;s really just a special case of option #1, since it works precisely
because a constant <code>Ellipse</code> doesn&#8217;t have a <code>setSize(x,y)</code> method.)</p>

<h3 id="circle-ellipse-inversion">Perhaps Ellipse should inherit from Circle then?</h3>

<p>If <code>Circle</code> is the base class and <code>Ellipse</code> is the derived class, then you run into a whole new set of problems. For
example, suppose <code>Circle</code> has a <code>radius()</code> method. Then <code>Ellipse</code> will also need to have a <code>radius()</code> method, but that
doesn&#8217;t make much sense: what does it even mean for a possibly assymetric ellipse to have a radius?</p>

<p>If you get over that hurdle, such as by having <code>Ellipse::radius()</code> return the average of the major and minor axes or
whatever, then there is a problem with the relationship between <code>radius()</code> and <code>area()</code>. Suppose <code>Circle</code> has an
<code>area()</code> method that promises to return <em>pi</em> times the square of whatever <code>radius()</code> returns. Then either
<code>Ellipse::area()</code> will not return the true area of the ellipse, or you&#8217;ll have to stand on your head to get <code>radius()</code>
to return something that matches the above formula.</p>

<p>Even if you get past that one, such as by having <code>Ellipse::radius()</code> return the square root of the ellipse&#8217;s area
divided by pi, you&#8217;ll get stuck by the <code>circumference()</code> method. Suppose <code>Circle</code> has a <code>circumference()</code> method that
promises to return two times pi times whatever is returned by <code>radius()</code>. Now you&#8217;re stuck: there&#8217;s no way to make all
those constraints work out for <code>Ellipse</code>: the <code>Ellipse</code> class will have to lie about its area, its circumference, or
both.</p>

<p>Bottom line: you can make anything inherit from anything <em>provided</em> the methods in the derived class abide by the
promises made in the base class. But you ought not to use inheritance just because you feel like it, or just because you
want to get code reuse. You should use inheritance (a) only if the derived class&#8217;s methods can abide by all the promises
made in the base class, and (b) only if you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll confuse your users, and (c) only if there&#8217;s something to
be gained by using the inheritance &#8212; some real, measurable improvement in time, money or risk.</p>

<h3 id="circle-ellipse-generalization">But my problem doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with circles and ellipses, so what good is that silly example to me?</h3>

<p>Ahhh, there&#8217;s the rub. You <em>think</em> the <code>Circle</code>/<code>Ellipse</code> example is just a silly example. But in reality, <em>your</em>
problem is an isomorphism to that example.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care what your inheritance problem is, but all &#8212;yes <em>all</em>&#8212; bad inheritances boil down to the
<code>Circle</code>-is-not-a-kind-of-<code>Ellipse</code> example.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why: Bad inheritances always have a base class with an extra capability (often an extra member function or two;
sometimes an extra promise made by one or a combination of member functions) that a derived class can&#8217;t satisfy. You&#8217;ve
either got to make the base class weaker, make the derived class stronger, or eliminate the proposed inheritance
relationship. I&#8217;ve seen lots and lots and lots of these bad inheritance proposals, and believe me, they all boil down to
the <code>Circle</code>/<code>Ellipse</code> example.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you truly understand the <code>Circle</code>/<code>Ellipse</code> example, you&#8217;ll be able to recognize bad inheritance
everywhere. If you don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on with the <code>Circle</code>/<code>Ellipse</code> problem, the chances are high that
you&#8217;ll make some very serious and very expensive inheritance mistakes.</p>

<p>Sad but true.</p>

<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <code>public</code> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html" title="Section: Inheritance — private and protected inheritance"><code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> inheritance</a> are
different.)</p>

<h3 id="circle-ellipse-behavior">How could &#8220;it depend&#8221;??!? Aren&#8217;t terms like &#8220;Circle&#8221; and &#8220;Ellipse&#8221; defined mathematically?</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s irrelevant that those terms are defined mathematically. That irrelevance is why &#8220;it depends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first step in any rational discussion is to define terms. In this case, the first step is to define the terms
<code>Circle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code>. Believe it or not, most heated disagreements over whether class <code>Circle</code> should/shouldn&#8217;t
inherit from class <code>Ellipse</code> are caused by incompatible definitions of those terms.</p>

<p>The key insight is to forget mathematics and &#8220;the real world,&#8221; and instead accept as final the only definitions that are
relevant for answering the question: the classes themselves. Take <code>Ellipse</code>. You created a class with that name, so the
one and only final arbiter of what you meant by that term is your class. People who try to mix &#8220;the real world&#8221; into the
discussion get hopelessly confused, and often get into heated (and, sadly, meaningless) arguments.</p>

<p>Since so many people just don&#8217;t get it, here&#8217;s an example. Suppose your program says <code>class Foo : public Bar { ... }</code>.
This <em>defines</em> what you mean by the term <code>Foo</code>: the one, final, unambiguous, precise definition of <code>Foo</code> is given by
unioning the public parts of <code>Foo</code> with the public parts of its base class, <code>Bar</code>. Now suppose you decide to rename
<code>Bar</code> to <code>Ellipse</code> and <code>Foo</code> to <code>Circle</code>. This means that you (yes you; not &#8220;mathematics&#8221;; not &#8220;history&#8221;; not
&#8220;precedence&#8221; nor Euclid nor Euler nor any other famous mathematician; little old you) have <em>defined</em> the meaning of the
term <code>Circle</code> within your program. If you defined it in a way that didn&#8217;t correspond to people&#8217;s intuitive notion of
circles, then you probably should have chosen a better label for your class, but nonetheless your definition is the one,
final, unambiguous, precise definition of the term <code>Circle</code> in your program. If somebody else outside your program
defines the same term differently, that other definition is irrelevant to questions about your program, even if the
&#8220;somebody else&#8221; is Euclid. <em>Within your program,</em> you define the terms, and the term <code>Circle</code> is defined by your class
named <code>Circle</code>.</p>

<p>Simply put, when we are asking questions about words defined in <em>your</em> program, we must use <em>your</em> definitions of those
terms, not Euclid&#8217;s. That is why the ultimate answer to the question is &#8220;it depends.&#8221; It depends because the answer to
whether the thing your program calls <code>Circle</code> is properly substitutable for the thing your program calls <code>Ellipse</code>
depends on exactly how <em>your</em> <em>program</em> defines those terms. It&#8217;s ridiculous and misleading to use Euclid&#8217;s definition
when trying to answer questions about your classes in your program; we <em>must</em> use your definitions.</p>

<p>When someone gets heated about this, I always suggest changing the labels to terms that have no predetermined
connotations, such as <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code>. Since those terms do not evoke any mathematical relationships, people naturally
go to the class definition to find out exactly what the programmer had in mind. But as soon as we rename the class from
<code>Foo</code> to <code>Circle</code>, some people suddenly think <em>they</em> can control the meaning of the term; they&#8217;re wrong and silly. The
definition of the term is still spelled out exclusively by the class itself, not by any outside entity.</p>

<p>Next insight: inheritance means &#8220;is substitutable for.&#8221; It does <em>not</em> mean &#8220;is a&#8221; (since that is ill defined) and it
does <em>not</em> mean &#8220;is a kind of&#8221; (also ill defined). Substitutability is well defined: to be substitutable, the derived
class is allowed (not required) to add (not remove) public methods, and for each public method inherited from the base
class, the derived class is allowed (not required) to weaken preconditions and/or strengthen postconditions (not the
other way around). Further the derived class is allowed to have completely different constructors, static methods, and
non-public methods.</p>

<p>Back to <code>Ellipse</code> and <code>Circle</code>: <em>if</em> you define the term <code>Ellipse</code> to mean something that can be resized asymmetrically
(e.g., its methods let you change the width and height independently <em>and</em> guarantee that the width and height will
actually change to the specified values), then that is the final, precise definition of the term <code>Ellipse</code>. <em>If</em> you
define the thing called <code>Circle</code> as something that cannot be resized asymmetrically, then that is also your prerogative,
and it is the final, precise definition of the term <code>Circle</code>. <em>If</em> you defined those terms in that way, then obviously
the thing you called <code>Circle</code> is not substitutable for the thing you called <code>Ellipse</code>, therefore the inheritance would
be improper. QED.</p>

<p>So the answer is <em>always</em> &#8220;it depends.&#8221; In particular, it depends on the <em>behaviors</em> of the base and derived classes. It
does not depend on the <em>name</em> of the base and derived classes, since those are arbitrary labels. (I&#8217;m not advocating
sloppy names; I am, however, saying that you must not use your intuitive connotation of a name to assume you know what a
class does. A class does what it does, not what you think it ought to do based on its name.)</p>

<p>It bothers (some) people that the thing you called <code>Circle</code> might not be substitutable for the thing you called
<code>Ellipse</code>, and to those people I have only two things to say: (a) get over it, and (b) change the labels of the classes
if that makes you feel more comfortable. For example, rename <code>Ellipse</code> to <code>ThingThatCanBeResizedAssymetrically</code> and
<code>Circle</code> to <code>ThingThatCannotBeResizedAssymetrically</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I honestly believe that people who feel better after renaming the things are missing the point. The point
is this: in OO, a thing is defined by how it <em>behaves</em>, not by the label used to name it. Obviously it&#8217;s important to
choose good names, but even so, the name chosen does not define the thing. The definition of the thing is specified by
the public methods, including the contracts (preconditions and postconditions) of those methods. Inheritance is proper
or improper based on the classes&#8217; behaviors, not their names.</p>

<h3 id="sortedlist-kindof-list">If <code>SortedList</code> has <em>exactly</em> the same public interface as <code>List</code>, is <code>SortedList</code> a kind-of <code>List</code>?</h3>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>The most important insight is that the answer depends on the details of the base class&#8217;s contract. It is not enough to
know that the public interfaces / method signatures are compatible; one also needs to know if the contracts / behaviors
are compatible.</p>

<p>The important part of the previous sentence are the words &#8220;contracts / behaviors.&#8221; That phrase goes well beyond the
public interface = method signatures = method names and parameter types and <code>const</code>ness. A method&#8217;s contract means its
advertised behavior = advertised requirements and promises = advertised preconditions and postconditions. So if the base
class has a method <code>void insert(const Foo&amp; x)</code>, the contract of that method includes the signature (meaning the name
<code>insert</code> and the parameter <code>const Foo&amp;</code>), but goes well beyond that to include the method&#8217;s advertised preconditions and
postconditions.</p>

<p>The other important word is <em>advertised</em>. The intention here is to differentiate between the code inside the method
(assuming the base class&#8217;s method <em>has</em> code; i.e., assuming it&#8217;s not an unimplemented pure virtual function) and the
promises made outside the method. This is where things get tricky. Suppose <code>List::insert(const Foo&amp; x)</code> inserts a copy
of <code>x</code> at the end of <code>this</code> <code>List</code>, and the override of that method in <code>SortedList</code> inserts <code>x</code> in the proper
sort-order. Even though the override behaves in a way that is incompatible with the base class&#8217;s code, the inheritance
might still be proper <em>if</em> the base class makes a &#8220;weak&#8221; or &#8220;adaptable&#8221; promise. For example, if the advertised promise
of <code>List::insert(const Foo&amp; x)</code> is something vague like, &#8220;Promises a copy of <code>x</code> will be inserted somewhere within
<code>this</code> <code>List</code>,&#8221; then the inheritance is probably okay since the override abides by the advertised behavior even though
it is incompatible with the implemented behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The derived class must do what the base class <em>promises</em>, not what it actually does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key is that we&#8217;ve separated the advertised behavior (&#8220;specification&#8221;) from implemented behavior (&#8220;implementation&#8221;),
and we rely on the specification rather than the implementation. This is very important because in a large percentage of
the cases the base class&#8217;s method is an unimplemented pure virtual &#8212; the only thing that can be relied on is the
specification &#8212; there simply is no implementation on which to rely.</p>

<p>Back to <code>SortedList</code> and <code>List</code>: it seems likely that <code>List</code> has one or more methods that have contracts which
guarantee order, and therefore <code>SortedList</code> is probably not a kind-of <code>List</code>. For example, if <code>List</code> has a method that
lets you reorder things, prepend things, append things, or change the <code>i</code>th element, and if those methods make the
typical advertised promise, then <code>SortedList</code> would need to violate that advertised behavior and the inheritance would
be improper. But it all depends on what the base class advertises &#8212; on the base class&#8217;s contract.</p>

File: id-defns

Defines IDs for each FAQ and section.

Rule:
  FAQ editors should always use these IDs for every internal cross-reference within the FAQ.
  Always use indirect links ('[description][id-of-target]')  when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.
  Never  use  direct  links ('[description](url-of-target)') when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.

Reason:
  The FAQ is a living document -- we will split/join sections and move FAQs between sections.
  Those changes result in changes to the URL of the moved FAQs, which breaks all direct links -- many changes.
  However using indirect links means we need only change one thing in one place: this id-defns file.

Caveat:
  This rule applies only to internal cross-reference links, not to links to resources outside the FAQ.
  E.g., if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to FAQ 'y', then you should always use FAQ 'y's link-ID.
  However if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to some resource outside the FAQ, you have two choices:
  You can use a direct link to the external resource's URL ('[description](url-of-external-resource)'),
  or you can add the external resource to this file then link indirectly ('[description][id-of-external-resource]').
  Typically you would do the latter only when the FAQ contains more than one link to that external resource.
