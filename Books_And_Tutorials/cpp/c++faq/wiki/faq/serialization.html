<h2 id="serialization">Serialization and Unserialization</h2>

<h3 id="serialize-overview">What&#8217;s this &#8220;serialization&#8221; thing all about?</h3>

<p>It lets you take an object or group of objects, put them on a disk or send them through a wire or wireless transport
mechanism, then later, perhaps on another computer, reverse the process: resurrect the original object(s). The basic
mechanisms are to flatten object(s) into a one-dimensional stream of bits, and to turn that stream of bits back into
the original object(s).</p>

<p>Like the Transporter on Star Trek, it&#8217;s all about taking something complicated and turning it into a flat sequence of 1s
and 0s, then taking that sequence of 1s and 0s (possibly at another place, possibly at another time) and reconstructing
the original complicated &#8220;something.&#8221;</p>

<h3 id="serialize-selection">How do I select the best serialization technique?</h3>

<p>There are lots and lots (and lots) of if&#8217;s, and&#8217;s and but&#8217;s, and in reality there are a whole continuum of techniques
with lots of dimensions. Because I have a finite amount of time (translation: I don&#8217;t get paid for any of this), I&#8217;ve
simplified it to a <a href="serialization.html#serialize-decide-text-vs-binary" title="FAQ: How do I decide whether to serialize to human-readable ('text') or non-human-readable ('binary') format?">decision between using human-readable (&#8220;text&#8221;) or non-human-readable (&#8220;binary&#8221;)
format</a>, followed by a list of five techniques arranged more-or-less in increasing
order of sophistication.</p>

<p>You are, of course, not limited to those five techniques. You will probably end up mixing ideas from several techniques.
And certainly you can always use a more sophisticated (higher numbered) technique than is actually needed. In fact it
might be wise to use a more sophisticated technique than is minimally needed if you believe future changes will require
the greater sophistication. So think of this list merely as a good starting point.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot here, so get ready!</p>

<p>Remember: feel free to mix and match, to add to the above list, and, <em>if</em> you can justify the added expense, to use a
more sophisticated technique than is minimally required.</p>

<p>One more thing: the issues of inheritance and of pointers within the objects are logically unrelated, so there&#8217;s no
theoretical reason for #2 to be any less sophisticated than #3-5. However in practice it often (not always) works out
that way. So please do not think of these categories as somehow sacred &#8212; they&#8217;re somewhat arbitrary, and you are
expected to mix and match the solutions to fit your situation. This whole area of serialization has <em>far</em> more variants
and shades of gray than can be covered in a few questions/answers.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-decide-text-vs-binary">How do I decide whether to serialize to human-readable (&#8220;text&#8221;) or non-human-readable (&#8220;binary&#8221;) format?</h3>

<p>Carefully.</p>

<p>There is no &#8220;right&#8221; answer to this question; it really depends on your goals. Here are a few of the pros/cons of
human-readable (&#8220;text&#8221;) format vs. non-human-readable (&#8220;binary&#8221;) format:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Text format</strong> is easier to &#8220;desk check.&#8221; That means you won&#8217;t have to write extra tools to debug the input and
output; you can open the serialized output with a text editor to see if it looks right.</li>
<li><strong>Binary format</strong> typically uses fewer CPU cycles. However that is relevant only if your application is CPU bound and
you intend to do serialization and/or unserialization on an inner loop/bottleneck. Remember: 90% of the CPU time is
spent in 10% of the code, which means there won&#8217;t be any practical performance benefit unless your &#8220;CPU meter&#8221; is
pegged at 100%, and your serialization and/or unserialization code is consuming a healthy portion of that 100%.</li>
<li><strong>Text format</strong> lets you ignore programming issues like <code>sizeof</code> and little-endian vs. big-endian.</li>
<li><strong>Binary format</strong> lets you ignore separations between adjacent values, since many values have fixed lengths.</li>
<li><strong>Text format</strong> can produce smaller results when most numbers are small and when you need to textually encode binary
results, e.g., uuencode or Base64.</li>
<li><strong>Binary format</strong> can produce smaller results when most numbers are large or when you don&#8217;t need to textually encode
binary results.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might think of others to add as well&#8230; The important thing to remember is that one size does not fit all &#8212; make a
careful decision here.</p>

<p>One more thing: no matter which you choose, you might want to start each file / stream with a &#8220;magic&#8221; tag and a version
number. The version number would indicate the format rules. That way if you decide to make a radical change in the
format, you hopefully will still be able to read the output produced by the old software.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-text-format">How exactly do I read/write simple types in human-readable (&#8220;text&#8221;) format?</h3>

<p>Before you read this, make sure to <a href="serialization.html#serialize-decide-text-vs-binary" title="FAQ: How do I decide whether to serialize to human-readable ('text') or non-human-readable ('binary') format?">evaluate all the tradeoffs between human-readable and non-human-readable
formats</a>. The tradeoffs are non-trivial, so you should resist a knee-jerk reaction to
do it the way you did it on the last project &#8212; one size does not fit all.</p>

<p>After you have made an eyes-open decision to use human-readable (&#8220;text&#8221;) format, you should remember these keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>You probably want to use iostream&#8217;s <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operators rather than its <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> methods. The <code>&gt;&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operators are better for text mode, whereas <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> are better for binary mode.</li>
<li>When storing numbers, you&#8217;ll probably want to add a separator to prevent items from running together. One simple
approach is to always add a space (<code>' '</code>) before each number, that way the number <code>1</code> followed by the number <code>2</code>
won&#8217;t run together and look like a <code>12</code>. Since the leading space will automatically get soaked up by the <code>&gt;&gt;</code>
operator, you won&#8217;t have to do anything explicit to extract the leading space in the code that reads things back in.</li>
<li>String data is tricky because you have to unambiguously know when the string&#8217;s body stops. You can&#8217;t unambiguously
terminate all strings with a <code>'\n'</code> or <code>'"'</code> or even <code>'\0'</code> if some string might contain those characters. You might
want to use C++ source-code escape-sequences, e.g., writing <code>'\'</code> followed by <code>'n'</code> when you see a newline, etc.
After this transformation, you can either make strings go until end-of-line (meaning they are deliminated by
<code>'\n'</code>) or you can delimit them with <code>'"'</code>.</li>
<li>If you use C++-like escape-sequences for your string data, be sure to always use the same number of hex digits
after <code>'\x'</code> and <code>'\u'</code>. I typically use 2 and 4 digits respectively. Reason: if you write a smaller number of hex
digits, e.g., if you simply use <code>stream</code> <code>&lt;&lt;</code> <code>"\\x"</code> <code>&lt;&lt;</code> <code>hex</code> <code>&lt;&lt;</code> <code>unsigned(theChar)</code>, you&#8217;ll get errors when the
next character in the string happens to be a hex digit. E.g., if the string contains <code>'\xF'</code> followed by <code>'A'</code>, you
should write <code>"\x0FA"</code>, not <code>"\xFA"</code>.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t use some sort of escape sequence for characters like <code>'\n'</code>, be careful that the operating system
doesn&#8217;t mess up your string data. In particular, if you open a <code>std::fstream</code> without <code>std::ios::binary</code>, some
operating systems translate end-of-line characters.</li>
<li>Another approach for string data is to prefix the string&#8217;s data with an integer length, e.g., to write
<code>"now is the time"</code> as <code>15:now is the time</code>. Note that this can make it hard for people to read/write the file, since
the value just after that might not have a visible separator, but you still might find it useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember that these are primitives that you will need to use in the other FAQs in this section.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-binary-format">How exactly do I read/write simple types in non-human-readable (&#8220;binary&#8221;) format?</h3>

<p>Before you read this, make sure to <a href="serialization.html#serialize-decide-text-vs-binary" title="FAQ: How do I decide whether to serialize to human-readable ('text') or non-human-readable ('binary') format?">evaluate all the tradeoffs between human-readable and non-human-readable
formats</a>. The tradeoffs are non-trivial, so you should resist a knee-jerk reaction to
do it the way you did it on the last project &#8212; one size does not fit all.</p>

<p>After you have made an eyes-open decision to use non-human-readable (&#8220;binary&#8221;) format, you should remember these
keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you open the input and output streams using <code>std::ios::binary</code>. Do this even if you are on a Unix system
since it&#8217;s easy to do, it documents your intent, and it&#8217;s one less non-portability to locate and change down the
road.</li>
<li>You probably want to use iostream&#8217;s <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> methods instead of its <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operators. <code>read()</code>
and <code>write()</code> are better for binary mode; <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> are better for text mode.</li>
<li>If the binary data might get read by a different computer than the one that wrote it, be very careful about endian
issues (little-endian vs. big-endian) and <code>sizeof</code> issues. The easiest way to handle this is to anoint one of those
two formats as the official &#8220;network&#8221; format, and to create a header file that contains machine dependencies (I
usually call it <code>machine.h</code>). That header should define <code>inline</code> functions like <code>readNetworkInt(std::istream&amp; istr)</code>
to read a &#8220;network <code>int</code>,&#8221; and so forth for reading and writing all the primitive types. You can define the format
for these pretty much anyway you want. E.g., you might define a &#8220;network <code>int</code>&#8221; as exactly 32 bits in little endian
format. In any case, the functions in <code>machine.h</code> will do any necessary endian conversions, <code>sizeof</code> conversions,
etc. You&#8217;ll either end up with a different <code>machine.h</code> on each machine architecture, or you&#8217;ll end up with a lot of
<code>#ifdef</code>s in your <code>machine.h</code>, but either way, all this ugliness will be buried in a single header, and all the rest
of your code will be clean(er). Note: the floating point differences are the most subtle and tricky to handle. It
can be done, but you&#8217;ll have to be careful with things like <a href="newbie.html#nan" title="FAQ: What is this NaN thing?">NaN</a>, over- and under-flow, #bits in the mantissa
or exponent, etc.</li>
<li>When space-cost is an issue, such as when you are storing the serialized form in a small memory device or sending it
over a slow link, you can compress the stream and/or you can do some manual tricks. The simplest is to store small
numbers in a smaller number of bytes. For example, to store an unsigned integer in a stream that has 8-bit bytes,
you can hijack the 8th bit of each byte to indicate whether or not there is another byte. That means you get 7
meaningful bits/byte, so 0&#8230;127 fit in 1 byte, 128&#8230;16384 fit in 2 bytes, etc. If the average number is smaller
than around half a billion, this will use less space than storing every four-byte unsigned number in four 8-bit
bytes. There are lots of other variations on this theme, e.g., a sorted array of numbers can store the difference
between each number, storing extremely small values in unary format, etc.</li>
<li>String data is tricky because you have to unambiguously know when the string&#8217;s body stops. You can&#8217;t unambiguously
terminate all strings with a <code>'\0'</code> if some string might contain that character; recall that <code>std::string</code> can store
<code>'\0'</code>. The easiest solution is to write the integer length just before the string data. Make sure the integer length
is written in &#8220;network format&#8221; to avoid <code>sizeof</code> and endian problems (see the solutions in earlier bullets).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember that these are primitives that you will need to use in the other FAQs in this section.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-no-inherit-no-ptrs">How do I serialize objects that aren&#8217;t part of an inheritance hierarchy and that don&#8217;t contain pointers to other objects?</h3>

<p>This is the least sophisticated problem, and not surprisingly, it is also the least sophisticated solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every class should handle its own serialization and unserialization. You will typically create a member function that
serializes the object to some sink (such as a <code>std::ostream</code>), and another that allocates a <code>new</code> object, or perhaps
changes an existing object, setting the member data based on what it reads from some source (such as a
<code>std::istream</code>).</li>
<li>If your object physically contains another object, e.g., a <code>Car</code> object might have a member variable of type
<code>Engine</code>, the outer object&#8217;s <code>serialize()</code> member function should simply call the appropriate function associated
with the member object.</li>
<li>Use the primitives described earlier to read/write the simple types in <a href="serialization.html#serialize-text-format" title="FAQ: How exactly do I read/write simple types in human-readable ('text') format?">text</a> or
<a href="serialization.html#serialize-binary-format" title="FAQ: How exactly do I read/write simple types in non-human-readable ('binary') format?">binary</a> format.</li>
<li>If a class&#8217;s data structure might change someday, the class should write out a version number at the beginning of the object&#8217;s serialized output. Unless you are absolutely sure that there is no possible chance of the data structure changing at any point in the future, do yourself a favor and include the version number now.  It is <em>much</em> easier to put in a version number from the very beginning than to add one later when you have an unanticipated data structure change.  The version number simply represents the <em>serialized format</em>; it should <em>not</em> get incremented simply when the class&#8217;s behavior changes. This means the version numbers don&#8217;t need to be fancy &#8212; they usually don&#8217;t need a major and minor number.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="serialize-inherit-no-ptrs">How do I serialize objects that are part of an inheritance hierarchy and that don&#8217;t contain pointers to other objects?</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to serialize a &#8220;shape&#8221; object, where <code>Shape</code> is an abstract class with derived classes <code>Rectangle</code>,
<code>Ellipse</code>, <code>Line</code>, <code>Text</code>, etc. You would declare a <a href="abcs.html#pure-virtual-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'pure virtual' member function?">pure virtual</a> function
<code>serialize(std::ostream&amp;) const</code> within class <code>Shape</code>, and make sure the first thing done by each override is to write
out the <em>class&#8217;s</em> identity. For example, <code>Ellipse::serialize(std::ostream&amp;) const</code> would write out the identifier
<code>Ellipse</code> (perhaps <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">as a simple string</a>, but there are several alternatives discussed below).</p>

<p>Things get a little trickier when unserializing the object. You typically start with a <code>static</code> member function in the
base class such as <code>Shape::unserialize(std::istream&amp; istr)</code>. This is declared to return a <code>Shape*</code> or perhaps a <a href="freestore-mgmt.html#ref-count-simple" title="FAQ: How do I do simple reference counting?">smart
pointer such as <code>Shape::Ptr</code></a>. It <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">reads the class-name identifier</a>, then
uses some sort of creational pattern to create the object. For example, you might have a table that maps from the class
name to an object of the class, then use the <a href="virtual-functions.html#virtual-ctors" title="FAQ: What is a 'virtual constructor'?">Virtual Constructor Idiom</a> to create the object.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a concrete example: Add a <a href="abcs.html#pure-virtual-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'pure virtual' member function?">pure virtual</a> method <code>create(std::istream&amp;) const</code> within base
class <code>Shape</code>, and define each override to a one-liner that uses <code>new</code> to allocate an object of the appropriate derived
class. E.g., <code>Ellipse::create(std::istream&amp; istr) const</code> would be <code>{ return new Ellipse(istr); }</code>. Add a <code>static</code>
<code>std::map&lt;std::string,Shape*&gt;</code> object that maps from the class name to a representative (AKA <em>prototype</em>) object of the
appropriate class; e.g., <code>"Ellipse"</code> would map to a <code>new Ellipse()</code>. Function <code>Shape::unserialize(std::istream&amp; istr)</code>
would <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">read the class-name</a>, throw an exception if it&#8217;s not in the map
(<code>if (theMap.count(className) == 0)</code> <code>throw</code> <em>&#8230;something&#8230;</em>), then look up the associated <code>Shape*</code> and call its
<code>create()</code> method: <code>return theMap[className]-&gt;create(istr)</code>.</p>

<p>The map is typically populated during static initialization. For example, if file <code>Ellipse.cpp</code> contains the code for
derived class <code>Ellipse</code>, it would also contain a <code>static</code> object whose ctor adds that class to the map:
<code>theMap["Ellipse"] = new Ellipse()</code>.</p>

<p>Notes and caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>It adds a little flexibility if <code>Shape::unserialize()</code> passes the class name to the <code>create()</code> method. In particular,
that would let a derived class be used with two or more names, each with its own &#8220;network format.&#8221; For example,
derived class <code>Ellipse</code> could be used for both <code>"Ellipse"</code> and <code>"Circle"</code>, which might be useful to save space in the
output stream or perhaps other reasons.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s usually easiest to handle errors during unserialization by throwing an exception. You can return <code>NULL</code> if you
want, but you will need to move the code that reads the input stream out of the derived class&#8217; ctors into the
corresponding <code>create()</code> methods, and ultimately the result is often that your code is more complicated.</li>
<li>You must be careful to <a href="ctors.html#static-init-order" title="FAQ: What's the 'static initialization order fiasco'?">avoid the static initialization order fiasco</a> with the map used by
<code>Shape::unserialize()</code>. This normally means using the <a href="ctors.html#static-init-order-on-first-use" title="FAQ: How do I prevent the 'static initialization order fiasco'?"><em>Construct On First Use
Idiom</em></a> for the map itself.</li>
<li>For the map used by <code>Shape::unserialize()</code>, I personally prefer the <a href="ctors.html#named-ctor-idiom" title="FAQ: What is the 'Named Constructor Idiom'?">Named Constructor Idiom</a> over
the <a href="virtual-functions.html#virtual-ctors" title="FAQ: What is a 'virtual constructor'?">Virtual Constructor Idiom</a> &#8212; it simplifies a few steps. Details: I usually define a <code>typedef</code>
within <code>Shape</code> such as <code>typedef Shape* (*Factory)(std::istream&amp;)</code>. This means <code>Shape::Factory</code> is a &#8220;pointer to a
function that takes a <code>std::istream&amp;</code> and returns a <code>Shape*</code>.&#8221; I then define the map as
<code>std::map&lt;std::string,Factory&gt;</code>. Finally I populate that map using lines like <code>theMap["Ellipse"] = Ellipse::create</code>
(where <code>Ellipse::create(std::istream&amp;)</code> is now a <a href="pointers-to-members.html#fnptr-vs-memfnptr-types" title="FAQ: Is the type of 'pointer-to-member-function' different from 'pointer-to-function'?"><code>static</code> member function</a> of class
<code>Ellipse</code>, that is, the <a href="ctors.html#named-ctor-idiom" title="FAQ: What is the 'Named Constructor Idiom'?">Named Constructor Idiom</a>). You&#8217;d change the <code>return</code> value in function
<code>Shape::unserialize(std::istream&amp; istr)</code> from <code>theMap[className]-&gt;create(istr)</code> to <code>theMap[className](istr)</code>.</li>
<li>If you might need to serialize a <code>NULL</code> pointer, it&#8217;s usually easy since you already write out a class identifier so
you can just as easily write out a <em>pseudo</em> class identifier like <code>"NULL"</code>. You might need an extra <code>if</code> statement in
<code>Shape::unserialize()</code>, but if you chose my preference from the previous bullet, you can eliminate that special case
(and generally keep your code clean) by defining <code>static</code> member function <code>Shape* Shape::nullFactory(istream&amp;)</code>
<code>{ return NULL; }</code>. You add that function to the map as any other: <code>theMap["NULL"] = Shape::nullFactory;</code>.</li>
<li>You can make the serialized form smaller and a little faster if you tokenize the class name identifiers. For example,
write a class name only the first time it is seen, and for subsequent uses write only a corresponding integer index.
A mapping such as <code>std::map&lt;std::string,unsigned&gt; unique</code> makes this easy: if a class name is already in the map,
write <code>unique[className]</code>; otherwise set a variable <code>unsigned n = unique.size()</code>, write <code>n</code>, write the class name,
and set <code>unique[className] = n</code>. (Note: be <em>sure</em> to copy it into a separate variable. Do <em>not</em> say
<code>unique[className] = unique.size()</code>! You have been warned! Reason: the compiler might evaluate <code>unique[className]</code>
before <code>unique.size()</code>, and if so, <code>unique[className]</code> will pre-increment the size.) When unserializing, use
<code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; unique</code>, read the number <code>n</code>, and if <code>n</code> <code>==</code> <code>unique.size()</code>, read a name and <code>add</code> it to
the <code>vector</code>. Either way the name will be <code>unique[n]</code>. You can also pre-populate the first <em>N</em> slots in these tables
with the <em>N</em> most common names, that way streams won&#8217;t need to contain any of those strings.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="serialize-no-cycles-no-joins">How do I serialize objects that contain pointers to other objects, but those pointers form a tree with no cycles and no joins?</h3>

<p>Before we even start, you must understand that the word &#8220;tree&#8221; does <em>not</em> mean that the objects are stored in some sort
of tree-like data structure like <code>std::set</code>. It simply means that your objects point to each other, and the &#8220;with no
cycles&#8221; part means if you keep following pointers from one object to the next, you never return to an earlier object.
Your objects aren&#8217;t &#8220;inside&#8221; a tree; they <em>are</em> a tree. If you don&#8217;t understand that, you <em>really</em> should read <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">the
lingo FAQ</a> before continuing with this one.</p>

<p>Second, don&#8217;t use this technique if the <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">graph</a> might someday contain
<a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">cycles</a> or <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">joins</a>.</p>

<p>Graphs with neither cycles nor joins are very common, even with &#8220;recursive composition&#8221; <a href="how-to-learn-cpp.html#design-books" title="FAQ: Are there other OO books that are relevant to OO/C++?">design patterns like Composite
or Decorator</a>. For example, the objects representing an XML document or an HTML document can be
represented as a graph without joins or cycles.</p>

<p>The key to serializing these graphs is to ignore a node&#8217;s <em>identity</em> and instead to focus only on its <em>contents</em>. A
(typically recursive) algorithm dives through the tree and writes the contents as it goes. For example, if the current
node happens to have an integer <code>a</code>, a pointer <code>b</code>, a float <code>c</code>, and another pointer <code>d</code>, then you first <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">write the
integer</a> <code>a</code>, then recursively dive into the child pointed to by <code>b</code>, then <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">write the
float</a> <code>c</code>, and finally recursively dive into the child pointed to by <code>d</code>. (You don&#8217;t have to
write/read them in the declaration order; the only essential rule is that the reader&#8217;s order is consistent with the
writer&#8217;s order.)</p>

<p>When unserializing, you need a constructor that takes a <code>std::istream&amp;</code>. The constructor for the above object would
<a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">read an integer</a> and store the result in <code>a</code>, then would allocate an object to be stored in
pointer <code>b</code> (and will pass the <code>std::istream</code> to the constructor so it too can read the stream&#8217;s contents), <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">read a
<code>float</code></a> into <code>c</code>, and finally will allocate an object to be stored in pointer <code>d</code>. Be sure to
use <a href="exceptions.html#selfcleaning-members" title="FAQ: How should I handle resources if my constructors may throw exceptions?">smart pointers</a> within your objects, <a href="exceptions.html#selfcleaning-members" title="FAQ: How should I handle resources if my constructors may throw exceptions?">otherwise you will get a leak</a> if
an exception is thrown while reading anything but the first pointed-to object.</p>

<p>It is often convenient to use the <a href="ctors.html#named-ctor-idiom" title="FAQ: What is the 'Named Constructor Idiom'?">Named Constructor Idiom</a> when allocating these objects. This has
the advantage that you can <a href="freestore-mgmt.html#ref-count-simple" title="FAQ: How do I do simple reference counting?">enforce the use of smart pointers</a>. To do this in a class <code>Foo</code>, write a
<code>static</code> method such as <code>FooPtr Foo::create(std::istream&amp; istr)</code> <code>{ return new Foo(istr); }</code> (where <code>FooPtr</code> is a smart
pointer to a <code>Foo</code>). The alert reader will note how consistent this is with the technique discussed in <a href="serialization.html#serialize-inherit-no-ptrs" title="FAQ: How do I serialize objects that are part of an inheritance hierarchy and that don't contain pointers to other objects?">the previous
FAQ</a> &#8212; the two techniques are completely compatible.</p>

<p>If an object can contain a variable number of children, e.g., a <code>std::vector</code> of pointers, then the usual approach is to
<a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">write the number of children</a> just before recursively diving into the first child. When
unserializing, just <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">read the number of children</a>, then use a loop to allocate the appropriate
number of child objects.</p>

<p>If a child-pointer might be <code>NULL</code>, be sure to handle that in both the writing and reading. This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem
<a href="serialization.html#serialize-inherit-no-ptrs" title="FAQ: How do I serialize objects that are part of an inheritance hierarchy and that don't contain pointers to other objects?">if your objects use inheritance</a>; see that solution for details. Otherwise, if the first
serialized character in an object has a known range, use something outside that range. E.g., if the first character of a
serialized object is always a digit, use a non-digit like <code>'N'</code> to mean a <code>NULL</code> pointer. Unseralization can use
<code>std::istream::peek()</code> to check for the <code>'N'</code> tag. If the first character doesn&#8217;t have a known range, force one; e.g.,
write <code>'x'</code> before each object, then use something else like <code>'y'</code> to mean <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>If an object physically contains another object inside itself, as opposed to containing a pointer to the other object,
then nothing changes: you still recursively dive into the child-node as if it were via a pointer.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-no-cycles-trivial-joins">How do I serialize objects that contain pointers to other objects, but those pointers form a tree with no cycles and only &#8220;trivial&#8221; joins?</h3>

<p>As before, the word &#8220;tree&#8221; does <em>not</em> mean that the objects are stored in some sort of tree-like data structure like
<code>std::set</code>. It simply means your objects have pointers to each other, and the &#8220;no cycles&#8221; part means you can follow the
pointers from one object to the next and never return to an earlier object. The objects are not &#8220;inside&#8221; a tree; they
<em>are</em> a tree. If that doesn&#8217;t make sense, you <em>really</em> should read <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">the lingo FAQ</a> before
continuing with this one.</p>

<p>Use this solution if the <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">graph</a> contains <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">joins at the leaf nodes</a>, but
those joins can be easily reconstructed via a simple look-up table. For example, the parse-tree of an arithmetic
expression like <code>(3*(a+b) - 1/a)</code> <em>might</em> have joins since a variable-name (like <code>a</code>) can show up more than once. If
you want the graph to use the same exact node-object to represent both occurrences of that variable, then you could use
this solution.</p>

<p>Although the above constraints don&#8217;t fit with those of <a href="serialization.html#serialize-no-cycles-no-joins" title="FAQ: How do I serialize objects that contain pointers to other objects, but those pointers form a tree with no cycles and no joins?">the solution without any joins</a>,
it&#8217;s so close that you can squeeze things into that solution. Here are the differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>During serialization, ignore the join completely.</li>
<li>During unserializing, create a look-up table, like <code>std::map&lt;std::string,Node*&gt;</code>, that maps from the variable name
to the associated node.</li>
</ul>

<p>Caveat: this assumes that <em>all</em> occurrences of variable <code>a</code> should map to the same node object; if it&#8217;s more
complicated than this, that is, if some occurrences of <code>a</code> should map to one object and some to another, you might need
to use <a href="serialization.html#serialize-with-cycles" title="FAQ: How do I serialize objects that contain pointers to other objects, and those pointers form a graph that might have cycles or non-trivial joins?">a more sophisticated solution</a>.</p>

<p>Caveat: you need to take special care if your objects contain pointers which point to a member of some object, rather
than to the object itself. For example, if pointer &#8216;p&#8217; points to &#8216;x.y&#8217; and pointer &#8216;q&#8217; points to &#8216;x.z&#8217;, that is, they
point to data members within object &#8216;x&#8217; rather than to object &#8216;x&#8217; itself, when you serialize the pointers, you need to
recognize both point to the same identical object. You will need to serialize object &#8216;x&#8217;, not just &#8216;x.y&#8217; and &#8216;x.z&#8217;, and
you need to make sure upon unserialization &#8216;p&#8217; and &#8216;q&#8217; point again to the same identical object. The serialization
process will probably require a two-pass approach, and serialized pointer will probably need to store an offset within
the target object as well as the target object&#8217;s ID.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-with-cycles">How do I serialize objects that contain pointers to other objects, and those pointers form a graph that might have cycles or non-trivial joins?</h3>

<p>Caveat: the word &#8220;graph&#8221; does <em>not</em> mean that the objects are stored in some sort of data structure. Your objects form
a graph because they point to each other. They&#8217;re not &#8220;inside&#8221; a graph; they <em>are</em> a graph. If that doesn&#8217;t make sense,
you <em>really</em> should read <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">the lingo FAQ</a> before continuing with this one.</p>

<p>Use this solution if the <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">graph</a> can contain <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">cycles</a>, or if it can
contain more complicated kinds of <a href="serialization.html#serialize-graph-lingo" title="FAQ: What's all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?">joins</a> than are allowed by <a href="serialization.html#serialize-no-cycles-trivial-joins" title="FAQ: How do I serialize objects that contain pointers to other objects, but those pointers form a tree with no cycles and only 'trivial' joins?">the solution for trivial
joins</a>. This solution handles two core issues: it avoids infinite recursion and it
writes/reads each node&#8217;s <em>identity</em> in addition to its <em>contents</em>.</p>

<p>A node&#8217;s identity doesn&#8217;t normally have to be consistent between different output streams. For example, if a particular
file uses the number 3 to represent node <code>x</code>, a different file can use the number 3 to represent a different node, <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>There are some clever ways to serialize the graph, but the simplest to describe is a two-pass algorithm that uses an
<em>object-ID map</em>, e.g., <code>std::map&lt;Node*,unsigned&gt; oidMap</code>. The first pass populates our <code>oidMap</code>, that is, it builds a
mapping from object pointer to the integer that represents the object&#8217;s identity. It does this by recursively diving
through the graph, at each node checking if the node is already in <code>oidMap</code>, and if not, adding the node and a unique
integer to <code>oidMap</code> and recursively diving into the new node&#8217;s children. The unique integer is often just the initial
<code>oidMap.size()</code>, e.g., <code>unsigned n = oidMap.size(); oidMap[nodePtr] = n</code>. (Yes, we did that in two statements. You must
also. Do <em>not</em> shorten it to a single statement. You have been warned.)</p>

<p>The second pass iterates through the nodes of <code>oidMap</code>, and at each, writes the node&#8217;s identity (the associated integer)
followed by its contents. When writing the contents of a node that contains pointers to other nodes, instead of diving
into those &#8220;child&#8221; objects, it simply writes the identity (the associated integer) of the pointer to those nodes. For
example, when your node contains <code>Node* child</code>, simply <a href="serialization.html#serialize-simple-types" title="FAQ: How do I serialize/unserialize simple types like numbers, characters, strings, etc.?">write the integer</a> <code>oidMap[child]</code>.
After the second pass, the <code>oidMap</code> can be discarded. In other words, the mapping from <code>Node*</code> to <code>unsigned</code> should
<em>not</em> normally survive beyond the end of the serialization of any given graph.</p>

<p>There are also some clever ways to unserialize the graph, but here again the simplest to describe is a two-pass
algorithm. The first pass populates a <code>std::vector&lt;Node*&gt; v</code> with objects of the right class, but any child pointers
within those objects are all <code>NULL</code>. This means <code>v[3]</code> will point to the object whose oid is 3, but any child pointers
inside that object will be <code>NULL</code>. The second pass populates the child pointers inside the objects, e.g., if <code>v[3]</code> has
a child pointer called <code>child</code> that is supposed to point to the object whose oid is <code>5</code>, the second pass changes changes
<code>v[3].child</code> from <code>NULL</code> to <code>v[5]</code> (obviously encapsulation might prevent it from directly accessing <code>v[3].child</code>, but
ultimately <code>v[3].child</code> gets changed to <code>v[5]</code>). After unserializing a given stream, the <code>vector</code> <code>v</code> can normally be
discarded. In other words, the oids (<code>3</code>, <code>5</code>, etc.) mean <em>nothing</em> when serializing or unserializing a different stream
&#8212; those numbers are only meaningful within a given stream.</p>

<p>Note: if your objects contain <em>polymorphic pointers</em>, that is, base class pointers that might point at derived class
objects, then <a href="serialization.html#serialize-inherit-no-ptrs" title="FAQ: How do I serialize objects that are part of an inheritance hierarchy and that don't contain pointers to other objects?">use the technique described earlier</a>. You&#8217;ll also want to read some of the
earlier techniques for handling <code>NULL</code>, writing version numbers, etc.</p>

<p>Note: you should seriously consider the <a href="how-to-learn-cpp.html#design-books" title="FAQ: Are there other OO books that are relevant to OO/C++?">Visitor pattern</a> when recursively diving through the graph,
since serialization is probably just one of many different reasons to make that recursive dive, and they&#8217;ll all need to
avoid infinite recursion.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-conclusions">Are there any caveats when serializing / unserializing objects?</h3>

<p>One of the things you <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to do, except in unusual circumstances, is to make any changes to the node&#8217;s data
during the traversal. For example, some people feel they can map from <code>Node*</code> to integer by simply adding an integer as
a data member in the <code>Node</code> class. They also sometimes add a <code>bool haveVisited</code> flag as another data member within
<code>Node</code> objects.</p>

<p><em>But</em> this causes lots of multi-threading and/or performance problems. Your <code>serialize()</code> method can no longer be
<code>const</code>, so even though it is logically just a reader of the node data, and even though it logically makes sense to have
multiple threads reading the nodes at the same time, the actual algorithm writes into the nodes. If you fully understand
threading and reader/writer conflicts, the best you can hope for is to make your code more complicated and slower
(you&#8217;ll have to block all reader threads whenever <em>any</em> thread is doing <em>anything</em> with the graph). If you (or those who
will maintain the code after you!) don&#8217;t fully understand reader/writer conflicts, this technique can create very
serious and very subtle errors. Reader/writer and writer/writer conflicts are so subtle they often slip through test
into the field. Bad news. Trust me. If you don&#8217;t trust me, talk to someone you do trust. But don&#8217;t cut corners.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s lots more I could say, such as several simplifications and special cases, but I&#8217;ve already spent too much time
on this. If you want more info, spend some money.</p>

<h3 id="serialize-graph-lingo">What&#8217;s all this about graphs, trees, nodes, cycles, joins, and joins at the leaves vs. internal nodes?</h3>

<p>When your objects contain pointers to other objects, you end up with something computer scientists call a <em>graph</em>. Not
that your objects are stored inside a tree-like data structure; they <em>are</em> a tree-like structure.</p>

<p>Your objects correspond to the graph&#8217;s <em>nodes</em> AKA <em>vertices</em>, and the pointers within your objects correspond to the
graph&#8217;s <em>edges</em>. The graph is of a special variety called a <em>rooted</em>, <em>directed</em> graph. The root object to be serialized
corresponds to the graph&#8217;s <em>root node</em>, and the pointers correspond to <em>directed edges</em>.</p>

<p>If object <code>x</code> has a pointer to object <code>y</code>, we say that <code>x</code> is a <em>parent</em> of <code>y</code> and/or that <code>y</code> is a <em>child</em> of <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>path</em> through a graph corresponds to starting with an object, following a pointer to another object, etc., etc. to an
arbitrary depth. If there is a path from <code>x</code> to <code>z</code> we say that <code>x</code> is an <em>ancestor</em> of <code>z</code> and/or that <code>z</code> is a
<em>descendent</em> of <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>join</em> in a graph means there are two or more distinct paths to the same object. For example, if <code>z</code> is a child of
both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, then the graph has a join, and <code>z</code> is a <em>join node</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>cycle</em> in a graph means there is a path from an object back to itself: if <code>x</code> has a pointer to itself, or to <code>y</code>
which points to <code>x</code>, or to <code>y</code> which points to <code>z</code> which points to <code>x</code>, etc. A graph is <em>cyclic</em> if it has one or more
cycles; otherwise it is <em>acyclic</em>.</p>

<p>An <em>internal node</em> is a node with children. A <em>leaf node</em> is a node without children.</p>

<p>As used in this section, the word <em>tree</em> means a rooted, directed, acyclic graph. Note that each node within a tree is
also a tree.</p>

<!--
File: id-defns

Defines IDs for each FAQ and section.

Rule:
  FAQ editors should always use these IDs for every internal cross-reference within the FAQ.
  Always use indirect links ('[description][id-of-target]')  when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.
  Never  use  direct  links ('[description](url-of-target)') when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.

Reason:
  The FAQ is a living document -- we will split/join sections and move FAQs between sections.
  Those changes result in changes to the URL of the moved FAQs, which breaks all direct links -- many changes.
  However using indirect links means we need only change one thing in one place: this id-defns file.

Caveat:
  This rule applies only to internal cross-reference links, not to links to resources outside the FAQ.
  E.g., if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to FAQ 'y', then you should always use FAQ 'y's link-ID.
  However if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to some resource outside the FAQ, you have two choices:
  You can use a direct link to the external resource's URL ('[description](url-of-external-resource)'),
  or you can add the external resource to this file then link indirectly ('[description][id-of-external-resource]').
  Typically you would do the latter only when the FAQ contains more than one link to that external resource.
