<h2 id="const-correctness">Const Correctness</h2>

<h3 id="overview-const">What is &#8220;<code>const</code> correctness&#8221;?</h3>

<p>A good thing. It means using the keyword <code>const</code> to prevent <code>const</code> objects from getting mutated.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to create a function <code>f()</code> that accepted a <code>std::string</code>, plus you want to promise callers
not to change the caller&#8217;s <code>std::string</code> that gets passed to <code>f()</code>, you can have <code>f()</code> receive its <code>std::string</code>
parameter&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><code>void f1(const std::string&amp; s);     </code> <em>// Pass by reference-to-<code>const</code></em></li>
<li><code>void f2(const std::string* sptr);  </code> <em>// Pass by pointer-to-<code>const</code></em></li>
<li><code>void f3(std::string s);            </code> <em>// Pass by value</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In the <em>pass by reference-to-<code>const</code></em> and <em>pass by pointer-to-<code>const</code></em> cases, any attempts to change the caller&#8217;s
<code>std::string</code> within the <code>f()</code> functions would be flagged by the compiler as an error at compile-time. This check is
done entirely at compile-time: there is no run-time space or speed cost for the <code>const</code>. In the <em>pass by value</em> case
(<code>f3()</code>), the called function gets a copy of the caller&#8217;s <code>std::string</code>. This means that <code>f3()</code> can change its local
copy, but the copy is destroyed when <code>f3()</code> returns. In particular <code>f3()</code> cannot change the caller&#8217;s <code>std::string</code>
object.</p>

<p>As an opposite example, suppose you wanted to create a function <code>g()</code> that accepted a <code>std::string</code>, but you want to let
callers know that <code>g()</code> might change the caller&#8217;s <code>std::string</code> object. In this case you can have <code>g()</code> receive its
<code>std::string</code> parameter&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><code>void g1(std::string&amp; s);     </code> <em>// Pass by reference-to-non-<code>const</code></em></li>
<li><code>void g2(std::string* sptr);  </code> <em>// Pass by pointer-to-non-<code>const</code></em></li>
</ul>

<p>The lack of <code>const</code> in these functions tells the compiler that they are allowed to (but are not required to) change the
caller&#8217;s <code>std::string</code> object. Thus they can pass their <code>std::string</code> to any of the <code>f()</code> functions, but only <code>f3()</code>
(the one that receives its parameter &#8220;by value&#8221;) can pass its <code>std::string</code> to <code>g1()</code> or <code>g2()</code>. If <code>f1()</code> or <code>f2()</code>
need to call either <code>g()</code> function, a local copy of the <code>std::string</code> object must be passed to the <code>g()</code> function; the
parameter to <code>f1()</code> or <code>f2()</code> cannot be directly passed to either <code>g()</code> function. E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>void g1(std::string&amp; s);

void f1(const std::string&amp; s)
{
  g1(s);          // Compile-time Error since s is const

  std::string localCopy = s;
  g1(localCopy);  // Okay since localCopy is not const
}
</code></pre>

<p>Naturally in the above case, any changes that <code>g1()</code> makes are made to the <code>localCopy</code> object that is local to <code>f1()</code>.
In particular, no changes will be made to the <code>const</code> parameter that was passed by reference to <code>f1()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="const-and-type-safety">How is &#8220;<code>const</code> correctness&#8221; related to ordinary type safety?</h3>

<p>Declaring the <code>const</code>-ness of a parameter is just another form of type safety.</p>

<p>If you find ordinary type safety helps you get systems correct (it does; especially in large systems), you&#8217;ll find
<code>const</code> correctness helps also.</p>

<p>The benefit of <code>const</code> correctness is that it prevents you from <em>inadvertently</em> modifying something you didn&#8217;t expect
would be modified. You end up needing to decorate your code with a few extra keystrokes (the <code>const</code> keyword), with the
benefit that you&#8217;re telling the compiler <em>and</em> other programmers some additional piece of important semantic information
&#8212; information that the compiler uses to prevent mistakes and other programmers use as documentation.</p>

<p>Conceptually you can imagine that <code>const std::string</code>, for example, is a different class than ordinary <code>std::string</code>,
since the <code>const</code> variant is conceptually missing the various mutative operations that are available in the non-<code>const</code>
variant. For example, you can conceptually imagine that a <code>const std::string</code> simply doesn&#8217;t have an assignment operator
<code>+=</code> or any other mutative operations.</p>

<h3 id="retrofitting-const">Should I try to get things <code>const</code> correct &#8220;sooner&#8221; or &#8220;later&#8221;?</h3>

<p>At the very, very, <em>very</em> beginning.</p>

<p>Back-patching <code>const</code> correctness results in a snowball effect: every <code>const</code> you add &#8220;over here&#8221; requires four more
to be added &#8220;over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Add <code>const</code> early and often.</p>

<h3 id="ptr-to-const">What does &#8220;<code>const X* p</code>&#8221; mean?</h3>

<p>It means <code>p</code> points to an object of class <code>X</code>, but <code>p</code> can&#8217;t be used to change that <code>X</code> object (naturally <code>p</code> could also
be <code>NULL</code>).</p>

<p>Read it right-to-left: &#8220;p is a pointer to an X that is constant.&#8221;</p>

<p>For example, if class <code>X</code> has a <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?"><code>const</code> member function</a> such as <code>inspect() const</code>, it is okay to say
<code>p-&gt;inspect()</code>. But if class <code>X</code> has a <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?">non-<code>const</code> member function</a> called <code>mutate()</code>, it is an
error if you say <code>p-&gt;mutate()</code>.</p>

<p>Significantly, this error is caught by the compiler at compile-time &#8212; no run-time tests are done. That means <code>const</code>
doesn&#8217;t slow down your program and doesn&#8217;t require you to write extra test-cases to check things at runtime &#8212; the
compiler does the work at compile-time.</p>

<h3 id="const-ptr-vs-ptr-const">What&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;<code>const X* p</code>&#8221;, &#8220;<code>X* const p</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>const X* const p</code>&#8221;?</h3>

<p>Read the pointer declarations right-to-left.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>const X* p</code> means &#8220;<code>p</code> points to an <code>X</code> that is <code>const</code>&#8221;: the <code>X</code> object can&#8217;t be changed <a href="const-correctness.html#ptr-to-const-aliasing" title="FAQ: Does 'const Fred* p' mean that *p can't change?">via
<code>p</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>X* const p</code> means &#8220;<code>p</code> is a <code>const</code> pointer to an <code>X</code> that is non-<code>const</code>&#8221;: you can&#8217;t change the pointer <code>p</code>
itself, but you can change the <code>X</code> object <a href="const-correctness.html#ptr-to-const-aliasing" title="FAQ: Does 'const Fred* p' mean that *p can't change?">via <code>p</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>const X* const p</code> means &#8220;<code>p</code> is a <code>const</code> pointer to an <code>X</code> that is <code>const</code>&#8221;: you can&#8217;t change the pointer <code>p</code>
itself, nor can you change the <code>X</code> object <a href="const-correctness.html#ptr-to-const-aliasing" title="FAQ: Does 'const Fred* p' mean that *p can't change?">via <code>p</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, oh yea, did I mention to read your pointer declarations right-to-left?</p>

<h3 id="ref-to-const">What does &#8220;<code>const X&amp; x</code>&#8221; mean?</h3>

<p>It means <code>x</code> aliases an <code>X</code> object, but you can&#8217;t change that <code>X</code> object <a href="const-correctness.html#ptr-to-const-aliasing" title="FAQ: Does 'const Fred* p' mean that *p can't change?">via <code>x</code></a>.</p>

<p>Read it right-to-left: &#8220;<code>x</code> is a reference to an <code>X</code> that is <code>const</code>.&#8221;</p>

<p>For example, if class <code>X</code> has a <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?"><code>const</code> member function</a> such as <code>inspect() const</code>, it is okay to say
<code>x.inspect()</code>. But if class <code>X</code> has a <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?">non-<code>const</code> member function</a> called <code>mutate()</code>, it is an error
if you say <code>x.mutate()</code>.</p>

<p>This is entirely symmetric with <a href="const-correctness.html#ptr-to-const" title="FAQ: What does 'const X* p' mean?">pointers to const</a>, including the fact that the compiler does all the checking at compile-time, which means <code>const</code> doesn&#8217;t slow down your program and doesn&#8217;t require you to write extra test-cases to check things at runtime.</p>

<h3 id="const-ref-alt">What do &#8220;<code>X const&amp; x</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>X const* p</code>&#8221; mean?</h3>

<p><code>X const&amp; x</code> is equivalent to <a href="const-correctness.html#ref-to-const" title="FAQ: What does 'const X&amp; x' mean?"><code>const X&amp; x</code></a>, and <code>X const* x</code> is equivalent to
<a href="const-correctness.html#ref-to-const" title="FAQ: What does 'const X&amp; x' mean?"><code>const X* x</code></a>.</p>

<p>Some people prefer the <code>const</code>-on-the-right style, calling it &#8220;consistent <code>const</code>.&#8221; Indeed the
<code>const</code>-on-the-right style can be more consistent than the alternative: the <code>const</code>-on-the-right style <em>always</em>
puts the <code>const</code> on the right of what it constifies, whereas the other style <em>sometimes</em> puts the <code>const</code> on the left
and <em>sometimes</em> on the right.</p>

<p>With the <code>const</code>-on-the-right style, a local variable that is <code>const</code> is defined with the <code>const</code> on the right:
<code>int const a = 42;</code>. Similarly a <code>static</code> variable that is <code>const</code> is defined as <code>static double const x = 3.14;</code>.
Basically every <code>const</code> ends up on the right of the thing it constifies, including the <code>const</code> that is <em>required</em> to be
on the right: <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?">with a <code>const</code> member function</a>.</p>

<p>Despite these benefits, the <code>const</code>-on-the-right style is not very popular, so organizations that have existing C++
code tend to continue using the traditional style so their overall codebase can have a consistent coding standards.</p>

<p>Another recommendation: pick the style that will be most appropriate for your organization&#8217;s <em>average maintenance
programmer</em>. Not the (few) gurus, not the (few) dolts, but the average maintenance programmer. Unless you&#8217;re willing to
fire them and hire new ones, make sure you use a syle that lets <em>them</em> understand your code.</p>

<p>That means you need to make a decision based on your realities, not based on someone else&#8217;s assumptions or prejudices.
One size does not fit all. There is no decision that is right for all organizations for all time, so don&#8217;t allow anyone
to make a knee-jerk decision in either direction. &#8220;Think&#8221; is not a four-letter word.</p>

<p>Another caveat: if you decide to use <code>const</code>-on-the-right style, do something to make sure your people don&#8217;t
mis-type <code>X const&amp;</code> as <a href="const-correctness.html#const-ref-nonsense" title="FAQ: Does 'X&amp; const x' make any sense?">the nonsensical &#8220;<code>X&amp; const x</code>&#8221;</a>. Similarly make sure people don&#8217;t
fat-finger <code>X const*</code> as <a href="const-correctness.html#const-ptr-vs-ptr-const" title="FAQ: What's the difference between 'const X* p', 'X* const p' and 'const X* const p'?">the semantically different but syntactically similar &#8220;<code>X* const</code>&#8221;</a>
&#8212; <code>X const*</code> and <code>X* const</code> have <a href="const-correctness.html#const-ptr-vs-ptr-const" title="FAQ: What's the difference between 'const X* p', 'X* const p' and 'const X* const p'?">completely different meanings</a>, even though they look
similar at first blush.</p>

<h3 id="const-ref-nonsense">Does &#8220;<code>X&amp; const x</code>&#8221; make any sense?</h3>

<p>No, it is nonsense.</p>

<p>To find out what the above declaration means, <a href="const-correctness.html#const-ptr-vs-ptr-const" title="FAQ: What's the difference between 'const X* p', 'X* const p' and 'const X* const p'?">read it right-to-left</a>: &#8220;<code>x</code> is a <code>const</code>
reference to a <code>X</code>&#8221;. But that is redundant &#8212; references are always <code>const</code>, in the sense that <a href="references.html#reseating-refs" title="FAQ: How can you reseat a reference to make it refer to a different object?">you can never reseat a
reference to make it refer to a different object</a>. Never. With or without the <code>const</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, &#8220;<code>X&amp; const x</code>&#8221; is functionally equivalent to &#8220;<code>X&amp; x</code>&#8221;. Since you&#8217;re gaining nothing by adding the
<code>const</code> after the <code>&amp;</code>, you shouldn&#8217;t add it: it will confuse people &#8212; the <code>const</code> will make some people think that
the <code>X</code> is <code>const</code>, as if you had said &#8220;<code>const X&amp; x</code>&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id="const-member-fns">What is a &#8220;<code>const</code> member function&#8221;?</h3>

<p>A member function that inspects (rather than mutates) its object.</p>

<p>A <code>const</code> member function is indicated by a <code>const</code> suffix just after the member function&#8217;s parameter list. Member
functions with a <code>const</code> suffix are called &#8220;<code>const</code> member functions&#8221; or &#8220;inspectors.&#8221; Member functions without a
<code>const</code> suffix are called &#8220;non-<code>const</code> member functions&#8221; or &#8220;mutators.&#8221;</p>

<pre><code>class Fred {
public:
  void inspect() const;   // This member promises NOT to change *this
  void mutate();          // This member function might change *this
};

void userCode(Fred&amp; changeable, const Fred&amp; unchangeable)
{
  changeable.inspect();   // Okay: doesn't change a changeable object
  changeable.mutate();    // Okay: changes a changeable object

  unchangeable.inspect(); // Okay: doesn't change an unchangeable object
  unchangeable.mutate();  // ERROR: attempt to change unchangeable object
}
</code></pre>

<p>The attempt to call <code>unchangeable.mutate()</code> is an error caught at compile time. There is no runtime space or speed
penalty for <code>const</code>, and you don&#8217;t need to write test-cases to check it at runtime.</p>

<p>The trailing <code>const</code> on <code>inspect()</code> member function should be used to mean the method won&#8217;t change the object&#8217;s
<em>abstract</em> (client-visible) state. That is slightly different from saying the method won&#8217;t change the &#8220;raw bits&#8221; of the
object&#8217;s <code>struct</code>. C++ compilers aren&#8217;t allowed to take the &#8220;bitwise&#8221; interpretation unless they can solve the
aliasing problem, which normally can&#8217;t be solved (i.e., a non-<code>const</code> alias could exist which could modify the state of
the object). Another (important) insight from this aliasing issue: pointing at an object with a pointer-to-<code>const</code>
doesn&#8217;t guarantee that the object won&#8217;t change; it merely promises that the object won&#8217;t change <em>via that pointer</em>.</p>

<h3 id="return-const-ref-from-const-memfn">What is the relationship between a return-by-reference and a <code>const</code> member function?</h3>

<p>If you want to return a member of your <code>this</code> object by reference from <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?">an inspector method</a>, you
should return it using reference-to-const (<code>const X&amp; inspect() const</code>) or by value (<code>X inspect() const</code>).</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
public:
  const std::string&amp; name_good() const;  // Right: the caller can't change the Person's name
  std::string&amp; name_evil() const;        // Wrong: the caller can change the Person's name
  int age() const;                       // Also right: the caller can't change the Person's age
  // ...
};

void myCode(const Person&amp; p)  // myCode() promises not to change the Person object...
{
  p.name_evil() = "Igor";     // But myCode() changed it anyway!!
}
</code></pre>

<p>The good news is that the compiler will <em>often</em> catch you if you get this wrong. In particular, if you accidentally
return a member of your <code>this</code> object by non-<code>const</code> reference, such as in <code>Person::name_evil()</code> above, the compiler
will <em>often</em> detect it and give you a compile-time error while compiling the innards of, in this case,
<code>Person::name_evil()</code>.</p>

<p>The bad news is that the compiler <em>won&#8217;t always</em> catch you: there are some cases where the compiler simply won&#8217;t ever
give you a compile-time error message.</p>

<p>Translation: you need to <em>think</em>. If that scares you, find another line of work; &#8220;think&#8221; is not a four-letter word.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?">the &#8220;<code>const</code> philosophy&#8221; spread throughout this section</a>: a <code>const</code> member function must
not change (or allow a caller to change) the <code>this</code> object&#8217;s <em>logical</em> state (AKA <em>abstract</em> state AKA <em>meaningwise</em>
state). Think of what an object <em>means</em>, not how it is internally implemented. A Person&#8217;s age and name are logically
part of the Person, but the Person&#8217;s neighbor and employer are not. An inspector method that returns part of the <code>this</code>
object&#8217;s logical / abstract / meaningwise state <em>must not</em> return a non-<code>const</code> pointer (or reference) to that part,
independent of whether that part is internally implemented as a direct data-member physically embedded within the
<code>this</code> object or some other way.</p>

<h3 id="const-overloading">What&#8217;s the deal with &#8220;<code>const</code>-overloading&#8221;?</h3>

<p><code>const</code> overloading helps you achieve <code>const</code> correctness.</p>

<p><code>const</code> overloading is when you have an <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?">inspector method</a> and a <a href="const-correctness.html#const-member-fns" title="FAQ: What is a 'const member function'?">mutator method</a>
with the same name and the same number of and types of parameters. The two distinct methods differ only in that the
inspector is <code>const</code> and the mutator is non-<code>const</code>.</p>

<p>The most common use of <code>const</code> overloading is with the subscript operator. You should generally try to use <a href="class-libraries.html#stl" title="FAQ: What is the 'STL'?">one of the
standard container templates</a>, such as <code>std::vector</code>, but if you need to create your own class that has a subscript
operator, here&#8217;s the rule of thumb: <strong>subscript operators often come in pairs.</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Fred { /*...*/ };

class MyFredList {
public:
  const Fred&amp; operator[] (unsigned index) const;  // Subscript operators often come in pairs
  Fred&amp;       operator[] (unsigned index);        // Subscript operators often come in pairs
  // ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>const</code> subscript operator returns a <code>const</code>-reference, so the compiler will prevent callers from inadvertently
mutating/changing the <code>Fred</code>. The non-<code>const</code> subscript operator returns a non-<code>const</code> reference, which is your way of
telling your callers (and the compiler) that your callers are allowed to modify the <code>Fred</code> object.</p>

<p>When a user of your <code>MyFredList</code> class calls the subscript operator, the compiler selects which overload to call based
on the constness of <em>their</em> <code>MyFredList</code>. If the caller has a <code>MyFredList a</code> or <code>MyFredList&amp; a</code>, then <code>a[3]</code> will call
the non-<code>const</code> subscript operator, and the caller will end up with a non-<code>const</code> reference to a <code>Fred</code>:</p>

<p>For example, suppose <code>class Fred</code> has an inspector-method <code>inspect() const</code> and a mutator-method <code>mutate()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void f(MyFredList&amp; a)  // The MyFredList is non-const
{
  // Okay to call methods that inspect (look but not mutate/change) the Fred at a[3]:
  Fred x = a[3];       // Doesn't change to the Fred at a[3]: merely makes a copy of that Fred
  a[3].inspect();      // Doesn't change to the Fred at a[3]: inspect() const is an inspector-method

  // Okay to call methods that DO change the Fred at a[3]:
  Fred y;
  a[3] = y;            // Changes the Fred at a[3]
  a[3].mutate();       // Changes the Fred at a[3]: mutate() is a mutator-method
}
</code></pre>

<p>However if the caller has a <code>const MyFredList a</code> or <code>const MyFredList&amp; a</code>, then <code>a[3]</code> will call the <code>const</code> subscript
operator, and the caller will end up with a <code>const</code> reference to a <code>Fred</code>. This allows the caller to inspect the <code>Fred</code>
at <code>a[3]</code>, but it prevents the caller from inadvertently mutating/changing the <code>Fred</code> at <code>a[3]</code>.</p>

<pre><code>void f(const MyFredList&amp; a)  // The MyFredList is const
{
  // Okay to call methods that DON'T change the Fred at a[3]:
  Fred x = a[3];
  a[3].inspect();

  // Compile-time error (fortunately!) if you try to mutate/change the Fred at a[3]:
  Fred y;
  a[3] = y;       // Fortunately(!) the compiler catches this error at compile-time
  a[3].mutate();  // Fortunately(!) the compiler catches this error at compile-time
}
</code></pre>

<p>Const overloading for subscript- and funcall-operators is illustrated <a href="operator-overloading.html#matrix-subscript-op" title="FAQ: How do I create a subscript operator for a Matrix class?">here</a>,

<p>You can, of course, also use <code>const</code>-overloading for things other than the subscript operator.</p>

<h3 id="logical-vs-physical-state">How can it help me design better classes if I distinguish <em>logical state</em> from <em>physical state</em>?</h3>

<p>Because that encourages you to design your classes from the outside-in rather than from the inside-out, which in turn
makes your classes and objects easier to understand and use, more intuitive, less error prone, and faster. (Okay, that&#8217;s
a slight over-simplification. To understand all the if&#8217;s and&#8217;s and but&#8217;s, you&#8217;ll just have to read the rest of this
answer!)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s understand this from the inside-out &#8212; <a href="operator-overloading.html#design-interfaces-first" title="FAQ: Should I design my classes from the outside (interfaces first) or from the inside (data first)?">you will (should) design your classes from the
outside-in</a>, but if you&#8217;re new to this concept, it&#8217;s easier to understand from the
inside-out.</p>

<p>On the inside, your objects have physical (or concrete or bitwise) state. This is the state that&#8217;s easy for programmers
to see and understand; it&#8217;s the state that would be there if the class were just a C-style <code>struct</code>.</p>

<p>On the outside, your objects have users of your class, and these users are restricted to using only <code>public</code> member
functions and <a href="friends.html" title="Section: Friends"><code>friend</code>s</a>. These external users also perceive the object as having state, for example, if the
object is of class <code>Rectangle</code> with methods <code>width()</code>, <code>height()</code> and <code>area()</code>, your users would say that those three
are all part of the object&#8217;s logical (or abstract or meaningwise) state. To an external user, the <code>Rectangle</code> object
actually has an area, even if that area is computed on the fly (e.g., if the <code>area()</code> method returns the product of the
object&#8217;s width and height). In fact, and this is the important point, your users don&#8217;t know and don&#8217;t care how you
implement any of these methods; your users still perceive, from their perspective, that your object logically has a
meaningwise state of width, height, and area.</p>

<p>The <code>area()</code> example shows a case where the logical state can contain elements that are not directly realized in the
physical state. The opposite is also true: classes sometimes intentionally hide part of their objects&#8217; physical
(concrete, bitwise) state from users &#8212; they intentionally do not provide any <code>public</code> member functions or
<a href="friends.html" title="Section: Friends"><code>friend</code>s</a> that would allow users to read or write or even know about this hidden state. That means there are
bits in the object&#8217;s physical state that have no corresponding elements in the object&#8217;s logical state.</p>

<p>As an example of this latter case, a collection-object might cache its last lookup in hopes of improving the
performance of its next lookup. This cache is certainly part of the object&#8217;s physical state, but there it is an internal
implementation detail that will probably not be exposed to users &#8212; it will probably not be part of the object&#8217;s
logical state. Telling what&#8217;s what is easy if you think from the outside-in: if the collection-object&#8217;s users have no
way to check the state of the cache itself, then the cache is <em>transparent</em>, and is not part of the object&#8217;s logical
state.</p>

<h3 id="logical-vs-physical-const">Should the <code>const</code>ness of my <code>public</code> member functions be based on what the method does to the object&#8217;s <em>logical state</em>, or <em>physical state</em>?</h3>

<p>Logical.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no way to make this next part easy. It <em>is</em> going to hurt. Best recommendation is to sit down. And please, for
your safety, make sure there are no sharp implements nearby.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go back to <a href="const-correctness.html#logical-vs-physical-state" title="FAQ: How can it help me design better classes if I distinguish logical state from physical state?">the collection-object example</a>. Remember: there&#8217;s a lookup method that
caches the last lookup in hopes to speed up future lookups.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s state what is probably obvious: assume that the lookup method makes <em>no</em> changes to <em>any</em> of the
collection-object&#8217;s logical state.</p>

<p>So&#8230; the time has come to hurt you. Are you ready?</p>

<p>Here comes: if the lookup method does not make any change to any of the collection-object&#8217;s logical state, but it
<em>does</em> change the collection-object&#8217;s <em>physical</em> state (it makes a very real change to the very real cache), should the
lookup method be <code>const</code>?</p>

<p>The answer is a resounding Yes. (There are exceptions to every rule, so &#8220;Yes&#8221; should really have an asterisk next to it,
but the vast majority of the time, the answer is Yes.)</p>

<p>This is all about &#8220;<em>logical</em> <code>const</code>&#8221; over &#8220;<em>physical</em> <code>const</code>.&#8221; It means the decision about whether to decorate a
method with <code>const</code> should hinge primarily on whether that method leaves the <em>logical</em> state unchanged, <em>irrespective</em>
(are you sitting down?) (you might want to sit down) <em>irrespective</em> of whether the method happens to make very real
changes to the object&#8217;s very real physical state.</p>

<p>In case that didn&#8217;t sink in, or in case you are not yet in pain, let&#8217;s tease it apart into two cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a method changes any part of the object&#8217;s logical state, it logically is a mutator; it should not be <code>const</code> <em>even
if</em> (as actually happens!) the method doesn&#8217;t change any physical bits of the object&#8217;s concrete state.</li>
<li>Conversely, a method is logically an inspector and should be <code>const</code> if it never changes any part of the object&#8217;s
logical state, even if (as actually happens!) the method changes physical bits of the object&#8217;s concrete state.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re confused, read it again.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not confused but are angry, good: you may not like it yet, but at least you understand it. Take a deep breath
and repeat after me: <em>&#8220;The <code>const</code>ness of a method should makes sense from outside the object.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re still angry, repeat this three times: <em>&#8220;The constness of a method must make sense to the object&#8217;s users, and those users can see only the object&#8217;s logical state.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re still angry, sorry, it is what it is. Suck it up and live with it. Yes, there will be exceptions; every rule
has them. But as a rule, in the main, this <em>logical <code>const</code></em> notion is good for you and good for your software.</p>

<p>One more thing. This is going to get inane, but let&#8217;s be precise about whether a method changes the object&#8217;s logical
state. If you are <em>outside</em> the class &#8212; you are a normal user, every experiment you could perform (every method or
sequence of methods you call) would have the <em>same results</em> (same return values, same exceptions or lack of exceptions)
irrespective of whether you first called that lookup method. If the lookup function changed <em>any</em> future behavior of
<em>any</em> future method (not just making it faster but changed the outcome, changed the return value, changed the
exception), then the lookup method changed the object&#8217;s logical state &#8212; it is a mutuator. But if the lookup method
changed nothing other than perhaps making some things faster, then it is an inspector.</p>

<h3 id="mutable-data-members">What do I do if I want a <code>const</code> member function to make an &#8220;invisible&#8221; change to a data member?</h3>

<p>Use <code>mutable</code> (or, as a last resort, use <code>const_cast</code>).</p>

<p>A small percentage of inspectors need to make changes to an object&#8217;s physical state that cannot be observed by external
users &#8212; changes to <a href="const-correctness.html#logical-vs-physical-state" title="FAQ: How can it help me design better classes if I distinguish logical state from physical state?">the physical but not logical state</a>.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="const-correctness.html#logical-vs-physical-state" title="FAQ: How can it help me design better classes if I distinguish logical state from physical state?">the collection-object discussed earlier</a> cached its last lookup in hopes of
improving the performance of its next lookup. Since the cache, in this example, cannot be directly observed by any part
of the collection-object&#8217;s public interface (other than timing), its existence and state is not part of the object&#8217;s
logical state, so changes to it are invisible to external users. The lookup method is an inspector <a href="const-correctness.html#logical-vs-physical-const" title="FAQ: Should the constness of my public member functions be based on what the method does to the object's logical state, or physical state?">since it never
changes the object&#8217;s logical state, irrespective of the fact that, at least for the present implementation, it changes
the object&#8217;s physical state</a>.</p>

<p>When methods change the physical but not logical state, the method should generally be marked as <code>const</code> since it really
is an inspector-method. That creates a problem: when the compiler sees your <code>const</code> method changing the physical state
of the <code>this</code> object, it will complain &#8212; it will give your code an error message.</p>

<p>The C++ compiler language uses the <code>mutable</code> keyword to help you embrace this <em>logical <code>const</code></em> notion. In this case,
you would mark the cache with the <code>mutable</code> keyword, that way the compiler knows it is allowed to change inside a
<code>const</code> method or via any other <code>const</code> pointer or reference. In our lingo, the <code>mutable</code> keyword marks those portions
of the object&#8217;s physical state which are not part of the logical state.</p>

<p>The <code>mutable</code> keyword goes just before the data member&#8217;s declaration, that is, the same place where you could put
<code>const</code>. The other approach, not preferred, is to cast away the <code>const</code>&#8216;ness of the <code>this</code> pointer, probably via the
<code>const_cast</code> keyword:</p>

<pre><code>Set* self = const_cast&lt;Set*&gt;(this);
  // See the NOTE below before doing this!
</code></pre>

<p>After this line, <code>self</code> will have the same bits as <code>this</code>, that is, <code>self == this</code>, but <code>self</code> is a <code>Set*</code> rather than a
<code>const Set*</code> (technically <code>this</code> is a <code>const Set* const</code>, but the right-most <code>const</code> is irrelevant to this discussion).
That means you can use <code>self</code> to modify the object pointed to by <code>this</code>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> there is an extremely unlikely error that can occur with <code>const_cast</code>. It only happens when three very rare
things are combined at the same time: a data member that ought to be <code>mutable</code> (such as is discussed above), a compiler
that doesn&#8217;t support the <code>mutable</code> keyword and/or a programmer who doesn&#8217;t use it, and an object that was originally
defined to be <code>const</code> (as opposed to a normal, non-<code>const</code> object that is pointed to by a pointer-to-<code>const</code>).
Although this combination is so rare that it may never happen to you, if it ever did happen, the code may not work (the
Standard says the behavior is undefined).</p>

<p>If you ever want to use <code>const_cast</code>, use <code>mutable</code> instead. In other words, if you ever need to change a member of an
object, and that object is pointed to by a pointer-to-<code>const</code>, the safest and simplest thing to do is add <code>mutable</code> to
the member&#8217;s declaration. You can use <code>const_cast</code> if you are <em>sure</em> that the actual object isn&#8217;t <code>const</code> (e.g., if you
are sure the object is declared something like this: <code>Set</code> <code>s;</code>), but if the object itself might be <code>const</code> (e.g., if
it might be declared like: <code>const Set s;</code>), use <code>mutable</code> rather than <code>const_cast</code>.</p>

<p><em>Please</em> don&#8217;t write saying version <em>X</em> of compiler <em>Y</em> on machine <em>Z</em> lets you change a non-<code>mutable</code> member of a
<code>const</code> object. I don&#8217;t care &#8212; it is illegal according to the language and your code will probably fail on a different
compiler or even a different version (an upgrade) of the same compiler. Just say no. Use <code>mutable</code> instead. Write code
that is <em>guaranteed to work,</em> not code that <em>doesn&#8217;t seem to break.</em></p>

<h3 id="const-cast-and-optimization">Does <code>const_cast</code> mean lost optimization opportunities?</h3>

<p>In theory, yes; in practice, no.</p>

<p>Even if the language outlawed <code>const_cast</code>, the only way to avoid flushing the register cache across a <code>const</code> member
function call would be to solve the aliasing problem (i.e., to prove that there are no non-<code>const</code> pointers that point
to the object). This can happen only in rare cases (when the object is constructed in the scope of the <code>const</code> member
function invocation, and when all the non-<code>const</code> member function invocations between the object&#8217;s construction and the
<code>const</code> member function invocation are statically bound, and when every one of these invocations is also <code>inline</code>d, and
when the constructor itself is <code>inline</code>d, and when any member functions the constructor calls are <code>inline</code>).</p>

<h3 id="aliasing-and-const">Why does the compiler allow me to change an <code>int</code> after I&#8217;ve pointed at it with a <code>const int*</code>?</h3>

<p>Because &#8220;<code>const int* p</code>&#8221; means &#8220;<code>p</code> promises not to change the <code>*p</code>,&#8221; <em>not</em> &#8220;<code>*p</code> promises not to change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Causing a <code>const int*</code> to point to an <code>int</code> doesn&#8217;t <code>const</code>-ify the <code>int</code>. The <code>int</code> can&#8217;t be changed via the
<code>const int*</code>, but if someone else has an <code>int*</code> (note: no <code>const</code>) that points to (&#8220;aliases&#8221;) the same <code>int</code>, then that
<code>int*</code> can be used to change the <code>int</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>void f(const int* p1, int* p2)
{
  int i = *p1;         // Get the (original) value of *p1
  *p2 = 7;             // If p1 == p2, this will also change *p1
  int j = *p1;         // Get the (possibly new) value of *p1
  if (i != j) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "*p1 changed, but it didn't change via pointer p1!\n";
    assert(p1 == p2);  // This is the only way *p1 could be different
  }
}

int main()
{
  int x = 5;
  f(&amp;x, &amp;x);           // This is perfectly legal (and even moral!)
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>main()</code> and <code>f(const int*,int*)</code> could be in different compilation units that are compiled on different days
of the week. In that case there is no way the compiler can possibly detect the aliasing at compile time. Therefore there
is no way we could make a language rule that prohibits this sort of thing. In fact, we wouldn&#8217;t even want to make such a
rule, since in general it&#8217;s considered a feature that you can have many pointers pointing to the same thing. The fact
that one of those pointers promises not to change the underlying &#8220;thing&#8221; is just a promise made by the <em>pointer;</em> it&#8217;s
<em>not</em> a promise made by the &#8220;thing&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id="ptr-to-const-aliasing">Does &#8220;<code>const Fred* p</code>&#8221; mean that <code>*p</code> can&#8217;t change?</h3>

<p>No! (This is related to <a href="const-correctness.html#aliasing-and-const" title="FAQ: Why does the compiler allow me to change an int after I've pointed at it with a const int*?">the FAQ about aliasing of <code>int</code> pointers</a>.)</p>

<p>&#8220;<code>const Fred* p</code>&#8221; means that the <code>Fred</code> can&#8217;t be changed via pointer <code>p</code>, but there might be other ways to get at the
object without going through a <code>const</code> (such as an aliased non-<code>const</code> pointer such as a <code>Fred*</code>). For example, if you
have two pointers &#8220;<code>const Fred* p</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>Fred* q</code>&#8221; that point to the same <code>Fred</code> object (aliasing), pointer <code>q</code> can be
used to change the <code>Fred</code> object but pointer <code>p</code> cannot.</p>

<pre><code>class Fred {
public:
  void inspect() const;   // A const member function
  void mutate();          // A non-const member function
};

int main()
{
  Fred f;
  const Fred* p = &amp;f;
  Fred*       q = &amp;f;

  p-&gt;inspect();    // Okay: No change to *p
  p-&gt;mutate();     // Error: Can't change *p via p

  q-&gt;inspect();    // Okay: q is allowed to inspect the object
  q-&gt;mutate();     // Okay: q is allowed to mutate the object

  f.inspect();     // Okay: f is allowed to inspect the object
  f.mutate();      // Okay: f is allowed to mutate the object

  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="constptrptr-conversion">Why am I getting an error converting a <code>Foo**</code> → <code>const Foo**</code>?</h3>

<p>Because converting <code>Foo**</code> → <code>const Foo**</code> would be invalid and dangerous.</p>

<p>C++ allows the (safe) conversion <code>Foo*</code> → <code>Foo const*</code>, but gives an error if you try to implicitly convert <code>Foo**</code> →
<code>const Foo**</code>.</p>

<p>The rationale for why that error is a good thing is given below. But first, here is the most common solution: simply
change <code>const Foo**</code> to <code>const Foo* const*</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo { /* ... */ };

void f(const Foo** p);
void g(const Foo* const* p);

int main()
{
  Foo** p = /*...*/;
  // ...
  f(p);  // ERROR: it's illegal and immoral to convert Foo** to const Foo**
  g(p);  // Okay: it's legal and moral to convert Foo** to const Foo* const*
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason the conversion from <code>Foo**</code> → <code>const Foo**</code> is dangerous is that it would let you silently and accidentally
modify a <code>const Foo</code> object without a cast:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
public:
  void modify();  // make some modification to the this object
};

int main()
{
  const Foo x;
  Foo* p;
  const Foo** q = &amp;p;  // q now points to p; this is (fortunately!) an error
  *q = &amp;x;             // p now points to x
  p-&gt;modify();         // Ouch: modifies a const Foo!!
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>q = &amp;p</code> line were legal, <code>q</code> would be pointing at <code>p</code>. The next line, <code>*q = &amp;x</code>, changes <code>p</code> itself (since <code>*q</code>
is <code>p</code>) to point at <code>x</code>. That would be a bad thing, since we would have lost the <code>const</code> qualifier: <code>p</code> is a <code>Foo*</code> but
<code>x</code> is a <code>const Foo</code>. The <code>p-&gt;modify()</code> line exploits <code>p</code>&#8217;s ability to modify its referent, which is the real problem,
since we ended up modifying a <code>const Foo</code>.</p>

<p>By way of analogy, if you hide a criminal under a lawful disguise, he can then exploit the trust given to that disguise.
That&#8217;s bad.</p>

<p>Thankfully C++ prevents you from doing this: the line <code>q = &amp;p</code> is flagged by the C++ compiler as a compile-time
error. Reminder: <em>please</em> do <em>not</em> pointer-cast your way around that compile-time error message. Just Say No!</p>

<p>(Note: there is a conceptual similarity between this and <a href="proper-inheritance.html#derivedptrptr-to-baseptrptr" title="FAQ: Converting Derived* → Base* works okay; why doesn't Derived** → Base** work?">the prohibition against converting <code>Derived**</code> to
<code>Base**</code></a>.)</p>

<!--
File: id-defns

Defines IDs for each FAQ and section.

Rule:
  FAQ editors should always use these IDs for every internal cross-reference within the FAQ.
  Always use indirect links ('[description][id-of-target]')  when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.
  Never  use  direct  links ('[description](url-of-target)') when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.

Reason:
  The FAQ is a living document -- we will split/join sections and move FAQs between sections.
  Those changes result in changes to the URL of the moved FAQs, which breaks all direct links -- many changes.
  However using indirect links means we need only change one thing in one place: this id-defns file.

Caveat:
  This rule applies only to internal cross-reference links, not to links to resources outside the FAQ.
  E.g., if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to FAQ 'y', then you should always use FAQ 'y's link-ID.
  However if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to some resource outside the FAQ, you have two choices:
  You can use a direct link to the external resource's URL ('[description](url-of-external-resource)'),
  or you can add the external resource to this file then link indirectly ('[description][id-of-external-resource]').
  Typically you would do the latter only when the FAQ contains more than one link to that external resource.
