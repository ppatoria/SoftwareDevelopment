<h2 id="wg21">WG21 (ISO C++ Committee) Members</h2>

<p>The following are a few of the individual members of the ISO C++ committee.</p>

<h3 id="matt-austern">Matt Austern (Google, Concepts Study Group Chair)</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/matt-austern.png" alt="Matt Austern" title="Matt Austern" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve been involved with the standardization project since 1996, when I was working at SGI. I was one of the implementers of the SGI STL, and wrote most of the documentation. I&#8217;m the author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Generic-Programming-STL-Extending-Standard/dp/0201309564/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352223363&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=generic+programming+and+the+stl"><em>Generic Programming and the STL</em></a>, as well as a number of magazine articles about C++.</p>

<p>I served as chair of the standards committee&#8217;s Library Working Group, and I was the project editor for the Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions (&#8220;TR1&#8221;). I&#8217;m now one of Google&#8217;s committee representatives, and I&#8217;m chair of the standards committee&#8217;s study group on Concepts.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>My main work at Google is writing frameworks for distributed data processing, mostly using C++.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m one of the authors of Pregel, a framework for very large scale graph computation; I&#8217;ve also worked on MapReduce and other tools.</p>

<p>Before coming to Google I was a member of Apple&#8217;s compiler team, where I worked on GCC.</p>

<p>Google (2005-present)</p>

<p>Apple (2001-2005)</p>

<p>AT&amp;T Research (2000-2001)</p>

<p>SGI (1995-2000)</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>S.B. in physics and mathematics, MIT</p>

<p>Ph.D. in physics, UC Berkeley</p>

<h4>Personal information</h4>

<p>I grew up in Pittsburgh, but I&#8217;ve now been in California for more than half of my life. I&#8217;m now living in Palo Alto with my wife and daughter.</p>

<h3 id="dean-michael-berris">Dean Michael Berris (Google)</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/dean-michael-berris.jpg" alt="Dean Michael Berris" title="Dean Michael Berris" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m the main developer and the original maintainer of the <em>cpp-netlib</em> library, I write on <em><a href="http://cplusplus-soup.com/">cplusplus-soup.com</a></em>, and work in Google on some internal C++ libraries. I&#8217;ve submitted papers to the Evolution working group for rich pointers and reflection. I also contribute to the Boost C++ Libraries project.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve re-written a back-end service on a social network using C++ to accommodate multiple thousands of requests per second. A product of this is the memcache++ open source C++ library.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!" &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
</code></pre>

<p>This line got me into the world of C++ programming and is a very powerful demonstration of how I could make computers do things.</p>

<h3 id="chandler-carruth">Chandler Carruth (Google)</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/carruth.jpg" alt="Chandler Carruth" title="Chandler Carruth" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m one of the lead developers on the LLVM and Clang compiler projects, and helped drive Clang&#8217;s support for C++. I led the design of C++ tooling and automated refactoring systems built on top of Clang and now part of the Clang project.</p>

<p>I help represent both Clang and Google on the C++ standards committee. I&#8217;ve contributed a few small C++ library proposals that I hope to see through to standardization.</p>

<p>Within Google, I led the effort to scale the automated Clang-based refactoring tools up to our entire codebase, over 100 million lines of C++ code. We can analyze and apply refactorings across the entire codebase in 20 minutes. I&#8217;m also one of the vocal proponents of C++ helping to shape some of our core libraries and drive the style and conventions used for writing C++ in Google&#8217;s codebase forward.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>I have driven several LLVM optimizations in recent years, focused on dramatically improving how effectively modern C++ code can be optimized by the LLVM+Clang compiler.</p>

<p>In past lives, I helped build Google&#8217;s distributed build system and build several key pieces of our developers&#8217; infrastructure for working with our codebase. Before joining Google I started a doomed game technology company.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<pre><code>// Not C++ yet, but am committed to being able to do in a future version of C++ efficiently, and with no extra copies.
vector&lt;tuple&lt;Machine, Job&gt;&gt; pickMachines(vector&lt;Machine&gt;&amp;&amp; machines,
                                         vector&lt;Job&gt;&amp;&amp; jobs) {
  return zip(reverse(sort(machines, by([](const Machine&amp; m) { return m.load(); }))),
             sort(jobs, by([](const Job&amp; j) { return j.cost(); })));
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Work positions</h4>

<p>I lead the Clang and LLVM teams at Google.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>I received my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Wake Forest University.</p>

<h4>Personal information</h4>

<h3 id="stefanus-du-toit">Stefanus Du Toit (WG21 Project Editor Emeritus)</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/sdutoit-med.jpg" alt="Stefanus Du Toit" title="Stefanus Du Toit" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I was the Project Editor for C++11. In that position, my responsibility was to ensure the overall consistency and clarity of the standard. My first major contribution in this role was to open up the standards draft sources on github to make it easy to provide editorial contributions for the standard and simplify the writing of papers.</p>

<p>I also served as Secretary of the C++ committee from 2009 to 2011.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>In 2004, I co-founded RapidMind, a spin-off from the University of Waterloo. RapidMind was the first company to commercialize GPGPU technology, providing a high level platform to write parallel programs in C++ that could be mapped to processors as diverse as multi-core CPUs, GPUs and the IBM Cell Broadband Engine. RapidMind was acquired by Intel in 2009.</p>

<h4>Work positions</h4>

<p>Software Development Manager, Intel Waterloo.</p>

<p>Formerly Chief Architect, RapidMind Inc.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>BMath Computer Science, University of Waterloo, 2004.</p>

<h4>Personal information</h4>

<p>By the time I was 18, I had lived in four continents. I was born in South Africa, where I spent six years until moving to Germany with my family. In 1998, I spent just under three years living in Brunei, Southeast Asia, where I completed high school. I then moved to Canada at the ripe age of 16 to study computer science at the University of Waterloo. In Canada, I quickly found some roots, and am now happily married with two wonderful children, still living in the Kitchener-Waterloo area. When I’m not working or spending time with my family, I love to snowboard, drive fast cars, and watch good movies.</p>

<h3 id="j-daniel-garcia">J. Daniel Garcia (Spain)</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/j-daniel-garcia.jpg" alt="J. Daniel Garcia" title="J. Daniel Garcia" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I represent Spain in WG21. I have been participating in the ISO C++ committee since 2008 as head of the Spanish Delegation. I have also led to the constitution of the Spanish C++ standards committee where I am the chair since its creation. I also represent Spain in the ISO SC22 subcommittee (Programming Languages, their environments and system software interfaces). Although, I joined late during the last round of standardization for C++11, I had the opportunity to have some fun while adding <code>noexcept</code> specifications to a bunch of chapters of the standard library. I have also been a C++ evangelist among colleagues since I started programming in C++ back in 1989. I also wrote a C++ book (with solutions) in Spanish.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>I have been developing software mainly in C++ since 1989. Relevant systems includes a safety system for explosion avoidance in mines, a road control system for a bidirectional highway, a management system for civil engineering and components for a computer tomography machine. In 2001 I joined <a href="http://www.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/home">University Carlos III</a> where I have used C++ for research, building several simulators for distributed systems in C++ and using it for prototypes targeted for the aerospace industry.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<p>I love not needing casts any more for launching threads:</p>

    std::thread t2([](){ f1(200); });
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Work positions</h4>

<p>Since 2001 I am with the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University Carlos III of Madrid where I became an Associate Professor in 2006.</p>

<p>During 2000 and 2001 I was a Lecturer at Pontifical University of Salamanca.</p>

<p>From 1989 to 2001 I worked as software engineer and systems engineers in projects for companies in different sectors AITEMIN (mining), FCC and TOOL (both civil engineering), Siemens (medical equipment), DMR Consulting (IT consulting), Telefonica and British Telecom (Telco).</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>Ph. D. in Computer in Computer Science from University Carlos III of Madrid.</p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>Head of delegation for Germany to the ISO C++ committee.</p>

<p>In the German standardization institute (DIN like the paper formats DIN A4, DIN A3, …), I work as vice-chair of the programming language group. I founded the C++ User Group in Dresden.</p>

<p>I have written several evolution and library proposals which I loved to see in future standards.</p>

<p>I taught C++ for several years in different universities: TU Dresden, Indiana University, and TU Berlin.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>I am the author of the Matrix Template Library version 4 (MTL4), a widely used generic library for linear algebra. I am also author or co-author of the Parallel Boost Graph Library, ANGEL: a graph-based library for transformations in automatic differentiation, and ParGraph: another parallel graph library.</p>

<p>Thanks to porting MTL4 to CUDA, my company is member of the Dresden’s CUDA Center of Excellence.</p>

<h4>What’s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; inline T minimum(const T&amp; t) { return t; }

template &lt;typename T, typename ...P&gt;
inline auto minimum(const T&amp; t, const P&amp; ...p)
{
    using res_type= std::common_type_t&lt;T, P...&gt;;
    return std::min(res_type(t), res_type(minimum(p...)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>This little function template allows us to compute the minimum of an arbitrary number of values of different types. This is not rocket science but a cute example of how C++11 is more powerful than (most?) other languages and C++03. You are invited to try it. 
Unlike C++11, in C++14 we no longer need the redundant declaration of the result type and the more cumbersome <code>common_type</code> trait which we replaced thanks to <code>auto</code> return type deduction and <code>common_type_t</code> in C++14.&#8221;</p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I was instrumental in getting move semantics into C++11. This includes the rvalue reference and back-porting move semantics into the existing C++03 library, especially containers and algorithms. As part of this work I introduced <code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>move_iterator</code>.</p>

<p>I led the team on standardization of <code>thread</code>, <code>mutex</code>, <code>unique_lock</code>, and <code>condition_variable</code>. I invented <code>condition_variable_any</code>.</p>

<p>I led the <code>chrono</code> team and am responsible for uniting the common durations with the templated duration framework.</p>

<p>I served as Library Working Group Chairman from 2005-2010.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve written two complete implementations of the standard library, one of which implements C++11 and is open source (http://libcxx.llvm.org).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also co-authored an independent implementation of the Itanium ABI with Marshall Clow (http://libcxxabi.llvm.org).</p>

<p>I would like to standardize shared (read/write) locking and I/O for the <code>chrono</code> durations.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<pre><code>std::shared_mutex mut;                          // proposed 
std::condition_variable_any cv; 
... 
void get_data() { 
    std::shared_lock&lt;shared_mutex&gt; sl(mut);     // proposed 
    // mut is locked here 
    // ... 
    while (not_ready_to_proceed()) cv.wait(sl); // mut unlocked while waiting 
    // mut is locked here 
    // ... 
} // mut.unlock_shared()
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is locking a read/write mutex in read mode and then waiting on a condition variable with that read/write mutex. Try doing that in POSIX! And yet this is all implemented on top of POSIX mutexes and condition variables, and is exception-safe as well.</p>

<h4>Work positions</h4>

<p>One time I wrote a userspace Linux networking driver entirely in C++ for line-rate 10 GbE packet processing (limited in performance only by the memory bandwidth of the system).</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<p>With rich syntax and increasingly broad libraries C++ is the best language to precisely specify an interface without having to sacrifice efficiency or clarity. With care, almost any interface can be made simple and easy to use, while showing up any improper use as a compile time error.</p>

<pre><code>class Stopwatch {
    using clock = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock;

    bool is_running() const { return stop_time_ == clock::time_point::min(); }
    clock::time_point end_time() const { return is_running() ? clock::now() : stop_time_; }

    clock::time_point begin_time_{clock::now()}, stop_time_{clock::time_point::min()};

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/eric-niebler-med.jpg" alt="Eric Niebler" title="Eric Niebler" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>Eric is a long-time contributor to <a href="http://boost.org/">Boost.org</a>, including as a library
author, a release manager, and as a member of the Boost Steering
Committee. His most influential piece of code to date has probably been
his (in)famous <code>BOOST_FOREACH</code> macro, which has now mercifully been made
obsolete by C++11&#8217;s range-based <code>for</code> statement. Please use it.</p>

<p>He is also a member of the ISO C++ Standardization Committee, has
attended several meetings, and authored several committee papers. Eric&#8217;s
articles about C++ have appeared in the C/C++ Users&#8217; Journal, MSDN
Magazine, InformIT, <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource">The C++ Source</a> and <a href="http://cpp-next.com/">C++Next</a>; and he has spoken about
C++ at various conferences around the world including SD West, C++
Connections, <a href="http://cppnow.org/">BoostCon/C++Now</a>, and <a href="http://splashcon.org/">OOPSLA</a>. He co-headlined the Astoria
Seminar.</p>

<p>Right now, Eric is pushing the boundaries of C++11 to improve the
experience both of C++ library developers and of their users. He&#8217;s also
filing lots of compiler bugs.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>Eric is a big believer in the power of low-overhead abstraction and
actively promotes the design, implementation, and use of Domain-Specific
Languages. He has worked to bring this design methodology into the
mainstream with his <a href="http://boost.org/libs/proto">Boost.Proto</a> library for building Domain-Specific
Languages in C++.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

int main()
{
    // Create a Proto terminal that wraps a string.
    // Let's be cheeky and call it "cout_".
    proto::literal&lt; char const * &gt; cout_( "cout" );

    // Create an expression tree and pass it to display_expr
    // for pretty-printing.
    proto::display_expr(
        cout_ &lt;&lt; "hello" &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; "proto!"
    );

<h4>Personal information</h4>

<p>Eric grew up on Long Island, NY and attended the University of Virginia,
where he picked up enough of a computer science education to land a job
at Microsoft. After reading Andrei Alexandrescu&#8217;s &#8220;Modern C++ Design,&#8221;
he decided to make a career out of C++ and hasn&#8217;t looked back.</p>

<p>Another important book in Eric&#8217;s life is &#8220;Walden&#8221; by H.D. Thoreau, which
convinced Eric to question anything typically considered respectable. He
eventually quit his day job, built an independent consulting business
that freed him to travel, sold his belongings, and spent 2.5 years
traveling and working from the road. He is now easing back into civil
society in Seattle, WA, where you can typically find him quietly hacking C++ in

<p>I co-authored <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Oriented-Software-Architecture-System-Patterns/dp/0471958697/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352221968&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pattern+oriented+software+architecture">Pattern-oriented Software Architecture Vol. 1: A System of Patterns</a></em> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Patterns-Integrating-Engineering-Software/dp/0470858842/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352222000&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=security+patterns"><em>Security Patterns</em></a>. I am author of further patterns and book chapters and support the patterns community through Hillside. In my research I try to achieve &#8220;Decremental Development&#8221;: refactoring code to reduce its size to 10% while improving its design.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/herb-teaching.png" alt="Herb Sutter" title="Herb Sutter" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve served as convener (chair) of the ISO C++ committee WG21 from 2002-2008 and 2009-present, and as WG21 secretary from 1998 to 2002. My biggest contribution so far has been presiding over the development of the C++11 and C++14 standards, and contributing technically to a number of its features by leading or participating in the design of the concurrency memory model, lambda functions, <code>async</code>, futures, <code>enum class</code>, <code>nullptr</code>, and other C++11 features.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also written over 200 articles and four books about C++, and continue to give many talks about software development in general and C++ in particular. As a longtime C++ community member since about 1995, I was one of the moderators of <em>comp.lang.c++.moderated</em>, wrote the <em>Guru of the Week</em> series, served as a columnist for <em>C++ Report</em> (where I also served as editor), <em>C++ Users Journal</em>, and <em>Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Journal</em>, and most recently designed and organized the creation of <em>isocpp.org</em>.</p>

<p><img src="../../files/img/andrew-sutton.jpg" alt="Andrew Sutton" title="Andrew Sutton" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve been involved with C++ standardization since 2010, when I joined Texas A&amp;M University as a postdoctoral researcher working on projects related to generic programming and improved language support for generic programming.</p>

<p>I proposed Concepts Lite as a language extension for C++ along with
Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis, and I am the project editor for the
ISO Technical Specification of Concepts.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>I am the author of the Origin C++ Libraries, which is my playground for
experimenting with new language features in C++11 and C++14, and how they
impact the design generic libraries. Ideas from Origin have shown up in a
several C++ library proposals, and in a popular book about C++ by
Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>

<p>I am also the primary developer of upcoming concepts support for GCC.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<p>A declaration of the distance algorithm using Concepts Lite (including
features not yet proposed). Assume that <code>Signed</code> and <code>Input_iterator</code> are
previously defined concepts:</p>

<p><img src="../../images/uploads/daveed-vandevoorde_1.jpg" alt="Daveed Vandevoorde" title="Daveed Vandevoorde" /></p>

<h4>What have you done for C++?</h4>

<p>In the early nineties, I invented (or co-invented) various template-based programming techniques, including expression templates. In 1995, I brought these to the &#8220;library working group&#8221; of the standardization committee, and then got seduced by the core language side of that committee, where I mostly just try to help refine language proposals and fix defects in the standard. Perhaps my most significant contribution to the language is a small change that removes the need for a space between consecutive closing angle brackets (i.e., you can now write <code>list&lt;complex&lt;double&gt;&gt;</code> instead of <code>list&lt;complex&lt;double&gt; &gt;</code>). I&#8217;m the principal author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Templates-Complete-Guide-David-Vandevoorde/dp/0201734842/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352222654&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daveed+vandevoorde"><em>C++ Templates &#8211; The Complete Guide</em></a>, a well-regarded book detailing how C++ templates work and how they can be used effectively. I&#8217;m the co-founder (with Eric Schweitz) of the Usenet group <em>comp.lang.c++.moderated</em>.</p>

<h4>What are your other major accomplishments?</h4>

<p>I invented an optimal algorithm for finding the largest uniform subarray in a 2D array of boolean values (which is now apparently commonly used in computer vision application). Around the same time I also made some contributions to the field of image restoration (and particularly some early ideas about reducing boundary error artifacts).</p>

<h4>Work positions</h4>

<p>I currently work for Edison Design Group (EDG, http://www.edg.com): A small company at the forefront of C++ language development (we produced what is still the only full implementation of the C++03 language).</p>

<p>Architecture, design and implementation of a declarative UI framework (written, of course, in C++) that shipped on 200+ million mobile devices.</p>

<p>Architecture, design and implementation of a database controller/archival/replication module (written, again, in C++) for a radio broadcasting system that was in use without any need for architectural changes for almost a decade.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s a favorite short C++ code fragment (under 10 lines)?</h4>

<p>This is part of an implementation of a <code>switch</code>-<code>case</code>-like construct that can switch on anything that&#8217;s comparable with <code>operator==</code>, using variadic templates and lambdas. The bit shown does the recursive walking of cases, carrying the value to switch, the case value, and the case body into the recursion terminator function. The terminator simply invokes the case-body lambda (or any function object type, for that matter) if the comparison is true.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class X, class T, class U&gt; 
void super_case_impl(X val, T val2, U y)

<!--
File: id-defns

Defines IDs for each FAQ and section.

Rule:
  FAQ editors should always use these IDs for every internal cross-reference within the FAQ.
  Always use indirect links ('[description][id-of-target]')  when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.
  Never  use  direct  links ('[description](url-of-target)') when linking to the FAQ from within the FAQ.

Reason:
  The FAQ is a living document -- we will split/join sections and move FAQs between sections.
  Those changes result in changes to the URL of the moved FAQs, which breaks all direct links -- many changes.
  However using indirect links means we need only change one thing in one place: this id-defns file.

Caveat:
  This rule applies only to internal cross-reference links, not to links to resources outside the FAQ.
  E.g., if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to FAQ 'y', then you should always use FAQ 'y's link-ID.
  However if you are making a link from FAQ 'x' to some resource outside the FAQ, you have two choices:
  You can use a direct link to the external resource's URL ('[description](url-of-external-resource)'),
  or you can add the external resource to this file then link indirectly ('[description][id-of-external-resource]').
  Typically you would do the latter only when the FAQ contains more than one link to that external resource.
