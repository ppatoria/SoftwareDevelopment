UNIX environments use several techniques in the Pthreads implementation to achieve synchronization. They are: 
* Mutexes 
* Condition variables 
* Semaphores 
* Interlocked exchange
 
Similarly, the synchronization techniques available in the Windows environment are: 
* Spinlocks 
* Events 
* Critical sections 
* Semaphores 
* Mutexes 
* Interlocked exchange
