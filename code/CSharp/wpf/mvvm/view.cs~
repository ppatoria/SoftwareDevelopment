1.
Bind DataContext on the constructor (we will see a cleaner form to do this in the following section):

public SearchView()
{
  InitializeComponent();

  this.DataContext = new SearchViewModel();
}


2.
Going back to XAML, subscribe to the Click event in the Search button:

<Button Content="Search" 
  Click="Button_Click"
  (бн)
/>


3.
We launch the code in the Code-Behind to search:

private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
  SearchViewModel svm = this.DataContext as SearchViewModel;
  svm.ExecuteSearch();
}
