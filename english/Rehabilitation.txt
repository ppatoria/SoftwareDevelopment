Rehabilitation of Parishioner's
---------------------------

In my opinion prisoners should get a change of rehabilitation in the society. Why I have this opinion is because most if the crimes are committed in a fit of emotion and each individual has varying levels of sensitivity.

There is an ancient story in India. Four people commited same crime but king punished them in different ways.

King lef tthe first person without saying anything. He scolded the second person while he sent the third person to jail.
But he ordered to paint the the fourth person's face black and take him around the village on a donkey.  

After serving the punishment. First person committed suicide. Second person locked himself for days and didn't talk while the third person realized his mistakes while he was in the jail. But the fourth person was really shameless. When he was taken around the village with face painted black, he saw his son, and he asked him to get ready with the hot water.  he told him that he will come home after he is done with the entertainment.

Q should it be 4 persons or 4 people? diff between person and people usage
