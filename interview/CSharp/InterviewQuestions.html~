<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Const Vs ReadOnly </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>const: :: 
</p><ul>
<li>
You can think of const as a subset of static.  Constants are  accessed as if they were static fields, although they cannot use the static keyword. 
</li>
<li>
Value is evaluated at compile time. Const = value assigned at Compile time and unchangeable once established.
</li>
<li>
Initiailized at declaration only. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>readonly: :: 
</p><ul>
<li>
Can be either instance-level or static. 
</li>
<li>
Value is evaluated at run time. readonly = value assigned at run time and unchangeable once established
</li>
<li>
Can be initialized in declaration or by code in the constructor. 
</li>
<li>
readonly members are not implicitly static, and therefore the static keyword can be applied to a readonly field explicitly if required. 
</li>
<li>
A readonly member can hold a complex object by using the new keyword at initialization. 
</li>
<li>
readonly members cannot hold enumerations. 

</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Interfaces </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<ul>
<li>
An interface is like an abstract base class: any non-abstract type that implements the interface must implement all its members.
</li>
<li>
An interface cannot be instantiated directly.
</li>
<li>
Interfaces can contain events, indexers, methods, and properties.
</li>
<li>
Interfaces contain no implementation of methods.
</li>
<li>
Classes and structs can implement more than one interface.
</li>
<li>
An interface itself can inherit from multiple interfaces.

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-2_1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Explicit Interface Implementation </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_1">

<p>When a class implements two interfaces that contain a member with the same signature, then implementing that member on the class will cause ambiguity . 
Explicit Interface Implementation is used to remove that ambiguity.
For example:

<h3 id="sec-2_2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Struct </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_2">

<p>Limitations of struct: :: 
</p><ul>
<li>
Within a struct declaration, fields cannot be initialized unless they are declared as const or static.
</li>
<li>
A struct may not declare a default constructor (a constructor without parameters) or a destructor.
</li>
<li>
Structs are copied on assignment. When a struct is assigned to a new variable, all the data is copied, and any modification to the new copy does not change the data for the original copy. This is important to remember when working with collections of value types such as Dictionary&lt;string, myStruct&gt;.
</li>
<li>
Structs are value types and classes are reference types. 
</li>
<li>
Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using a new operator.
</li>
<li>
Structs can declare constructors that have parameters.
</li>
<li>
A struct cannot inherit from another struct or class, and it cannot be the base of a class. All structs inherit directly from System.ValueType, which inherits from System.Object.
</li>
<li>
A struct can implement interfaces.
</li>
<li>
A struct can be used as a nullable type and can be assigned a null value.

</li>

<h3 id="sec-2_3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Nullable Types </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_3">

<p>Nullable types are instances of the System.Nullable&lt;T&gt; struct. A nullable type can represent the correct range of values for its underlying value type, plus an additional null value. For example, a Nullable&lt;Int32&gt;, pronounced "Nullable of Int32," can be assigned any value from -2147483648 to 2147483647, or it can be assigned the null value. A Nullable&lt;bool&gt; can be assigned the values truefalse, or null. The ability to assign null to numeric and Boolean types is especially useful when you are dealing with databases and other data types that contain elements that may not be assigned a value. For example, a Boolean field in a database can store the values true or false, or it may be undefined. 
</p>


<pre class="example">class NullableExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int? num = null;
        if (num.HasValue == true)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine("num = " + num.Value);
        }
        else
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine("num = Null");
        }

        // y is set to zero
        int y = num.GetValueOrDefault();

        // num.Value throws an InvalidOperationException if num.HasValue is false
        try
        {
            y = num.Value;
        }
        catch (System.InvalidOperationException e)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        }
    }
}
</pre>



<p>
Nullable types have the following characteristics: ::
</p><ul>
<li>
Nullable types represent value-type variables that can be assigned the value of null. You cannot create a nullable type based on a reference type. (Reference types already support the null value.)
</li>
<li>
The syntax T? is shorthand for Nullable&lt;T&gt;, where T is a value type. The two forms are interchangeable.
</li>
<li>
Assign a value to a nullable type just as you would for an ordinary value type, for example int? x = 10; or double? d = 4.108. A nullable type can also be assigned the value null: int? x = null.
</li>
<li>
Use the Nullable&lt;T&gt;.GetValueOrDefault method to return either the assigned value, or the default value for the underlying type if the value is null, for example int j = x.GetValueOrDefault();
</li>
<li>
Use the HasValue and Value read-only properties to test for null and retrieve the value, as shown in the following example: if(x.HasValue) j = x.Value;
</li>
<li>
The HasValue property returns true if the variable contains a value, or false if it is null.
</li>
<li>
The Value property returns a value if one is assigned. Otherwise, a System.InvalidOperationException is thrown.
</li>
<li>
The default value for HasValue is false. The Value property has no default value.
</li>
<li>
You can also use the == and != operators with a nullable type, as shown in the following example: if (x != null) y = x;
</li>
<li>
Use the ?? operator to assign a default value that will be applied when a nullable type whose current value is null is assigned to a non-nullable type, for example int? x = null; int y = x ?? -1;
</li>
<li>
Nested nullable types are not allowed. The following line will not compile: Nullable&lt;Nullable&lt;int&gt;&gt; n;

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_4">

<p>The ?? operator is called the null-coalescing operator and is used to define a default value for a nullable value types as well as reference types. It returns the left-hand operand if it is not null; otherwise it returns the right operand.

The this keyword is used to define the indexers.
</li>
<li>
The value keyword is used to define the value being assigned by the set indexer.
</li>
<li>
Indexers do not have to be indexed by an integer value; it is up to you how to define the specific look-up mechanism.

<div id="outline-container-2_6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2_6"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> Delegates </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_6">

<p>A delegate is a type that defines a method signature. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate its instance with any method with a compatible signature.
Delegates have the following properties: ::
</p><ul>
<li>
Delegates are like C++ function pointers but are type safe.
</li>
<li>
Delegates allow methods to be passed as parameters.
</li>
<li>
Delegates can be used to define callback methods.
</li>
<li>
Delegates can be chained together; for example, multiple methods can be called on a single event.
</li>
<li>
Methods do not have to match the delegate signature exactly. For more information, see Using Variance in Delegates (C# and Visual Basic).
</li>
<li>
C# version 2.0 introduced the concept of Anonymous Methods, which allow code blocks to be passed as parameters in place of a separately defined method. C# 3.0 introduced lambda expressions as a more concise way of writing inline code blocks. Both anonymous methods and lambda expressions (in certain contexts) are compiled to delegate types. Together, these features are now known as anonymous functions. For more information about lambda expressions, see Anonymous Functions (C# Programming Guide).

</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2_6_1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2_6_1"><span class="section-number-4">2.6.1</span> Variance in Delegates </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2_6_1">

<p>When you assign a method to a delegate, covariance and contravariance provide flexibility for matching a delegate type with a method signature. Covariance permits a method to have return type that is more derived than that defined in the delegate. Contravariance permits a method that has parameter types that are less derived than those in the delegate type.
</p>
<p>
Covariance ::
&lt;br&gt;This example demonstrates how delegates can be used with methods that have return types that are derived from the return type in the delegate signature. The data type returned by DogsHandler is of type Dogs, which derives from the Mammals type that is defined in the delegate.
</p>


<pre class="example">class Mammals{}
class Dogs : Mammals{}

class Program
{
    // Define the delegate.
    public delegate Mammals HandlerMethod();

    public static Mammals MammalsHandler()
    {
        return null;
    }

    public static Dogs DogsHandler()
    {
        return null;
    }

    static void Test()
    {
        HandlerMethod handlerMammals = MammalsHandler;

        // Covariance enables this assignment.
        HandlerMethod handlerDogs = DogsHandler;
    }
}
</pre>




<p>
Contravariance ::
&lt;br&gt;This example demonstrates how delegates can be used with methods that have parameters of a type that are base types of the delegate signature parameter type. With contravariance, you can use one event handler instead of separate handlers. For example, you can create an event handler that accepts an EventArgs input parameter and use it with a Button.MouseClick event that sends a MouseEventArgs type as a parameter, and also with a TextBox.KeyDown event that sends a KeyEventArgs parameter.
</p>


<pre class="example">// Event hander that accepts a parameter of the EventArgs type.
private void MultiHandler(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    label1.Text = System.DateTime.Now.ToString();
}

public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();

    // You can use a method that has an EventArgs parameter,
    // although the event expects the KeyEventArgs parameter.
    this.button1.KeyDown += this.MultiHandler;

    // You can use the same method 
    // for an event that expects the MouseEventArgs parameter.
    this.button1.MouseClick += this.MultiHandler;

}

<h4 id="sec-2_6_2"><span class="section-number-4">2.6.2</span> When to Use Delegates Instead of Interfaces </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2_6_2">

<p>Use a delegate in the following circumstances: ::
</p><ul>
<li>
An eventing design pattern is used.
</li>
<li>
It is desirable to encapsulate a static method.
</li>
<li>
The caller has no need to access other properties, methods, or interfaces on the object implementing the method.
</li>
<li>
Easy composition is desired.
</li>
<li>
A class may need more than one implementation of the method.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Use an interface in the following circumstances: ::
</p><ul>
<li>
There is a group of related methods that may be called.
</li>
<li>
A class only needs one implementation of the method.
</li>
<li>
The class using the interface will want to cast that interface to other interface or class types.
</li>
<li>
The method being implemented is linked to the type or identity of the class: for example, comparison methods

</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sec-2_6_3"><span class="section-number-4">2.6.3</span> Multicast Delegates </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2_6_3">

<p>A useful property of delegate objects is that multiple objects can be assigned to one delegate instance by using the + operator. The multicast delegate contains a list of the assigned delegates. When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order. Only delegates of the same type can be combined.
The - operator can be used to remove a component delegate from a multicast delegate.
</p>


<pre class="example">using System;

// Define a custom delegate that has a string parameter and returns void.
delegate void CustomDel(string s);

class TestClass
{
    // Define two methods that have the same signature as CustomDel.

    }

    static void Main()
    {
        // Declare instances of the custom delegate.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2_7_4">

<p>When writing lambdas, you often **do not have to specify a type for the input parameters** because the compiler can infer the type based on the lambda body, the underlying delegate type, and other factors as described in the C# Language Specification. For most of the standard query operators, the first input is the type of the elements in the source sequence. So if you are querying an IEnumerable&lt;Customer&gt;, then the input variable is inferred to be a Customer object, which means you have access to its methods and properties:
</p>


<pre class="example">customers.Where(c =&gt; c.City == "London");
</pre>


<p>
The general rules for lambdas are as follows: ::
</p><ul>
<li>
The lambda must contain the same number of parameters as the delegate type.
</li>
<li>
Each input parameter in the lambda must be implicitly convertible to its corresponding delegate parameter.
</li>
<li>
The return value of the lambda (if any) must be implicitly convertible to the delegate's return type.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2_8_1">

<p>An event is a special kind of multicast delegate that can only be invoked from within the class that it is declared in. Client code subscribes to the event by providing a reference to a method that should be invoked when the event is fired. These methods are added to the delegate's invocation list through event accessors, which resemble property accessors, except that event accessors are named add and remove. In most cases, you do not have to supply custom event accessors. When no custom event accessors are supplied in your code, the compiler will add them automatically. However, in some cases you may have to provide custom behavior.

    add{

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_10">

<p>Provides **isolation**, **unloading**, and **security boundaries** for executing managed code.
</p>
<p>
The Benefits of Isolating Applications:
</p><ul>
<li>
**Faults in one application cannot affect other applications**. Because type-safe code cannot cause memory faults, using application domains ensures that code running in one domain cannot affect other applications in the process.
</li>
<li>
**Individual applications can be stopped without stopping the entire process**. Using application domains enables you to unload the code running in a single application. 
</li>
<li>
**Code running in one application cannot directly access code or resources from another application**. The common language runtime enforces this isolation by preventing direct calls between objects in different application domains. Objects that pass between domains are either copied or accessed by proxy. If the object is copied, the call to the object is local. That is, both the caller and the object being referenced are in the same application domain. If the object is accessed through a proxy, the call to the object is remote. In this case, the caller and the object being referenced are in different application domains. Cross-domain calls use the same remote call infrastructure as calls between two processes or between two machines. As such, the metadata for the object being referenced must be available to both application domains to allow the method call to be JIT-compiled properly. If the calling domain does not have access to the metadata for the object being called, the compilation might fail with an exception of type System.IO.FileNotFound. See Remote Objects for more details. The mechanism for determining how objects can be accessed across domains is determined by the object. For more information, see MarshalByRefObject Class.
</li>
<li>
**The behavior of code is scoped by the application in which it runs**. In other words, the application domain provides configuration settings such as application version policies, the location of any remote assemblies it accesses, and information about where to locate assemblies that are loaded into the domain.
</li>
<li>
**Permissions granted to code can be controlled by the application domain in which the code is running.**

</p>
<p>
At any given time, every thread is executing in an application domain. Zero, one, or more than one thread might be executing in any given application domain.

The volatile keyword indicates that a field can be modified in the program by something such as the operating system, the hardware, or a concurrently executing thread.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_14">

<p>Limits the number of threads that can access a resource or pool of resources concurrently.
</p>
<p>
Use the Semaphore class to control access to a pool of resources. Threads enter the semaphore by calling the WaitOne method, which is inherited from the WaitHandle class, and release the semaphore by calling the Release method.
The count on a semaphore is decremented each time a thread enters the semaphore, and incremented when a thread releases the semaphore. When the count is zero, subsequent requests block until other threads release the semaphore. When all threads have released the semaphore, the count is at the maximum value specified when the semaphore was created.
There is no guaranteed order, such as FIFO or LIFO, in which blocked threads enter the semaphore.
A thread can enter the semaphore multiple times, by calling the WaitOne method repeatedly. To release some or all of these entries, the thread can call the parameterless Release() method overload multiple times, or it can call the Release(Int32) method overload that specifies the number of entries to be released.
The Semaphore class does not enforce thread identity on calls to WaitOne or Release. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that threads do not release the semaphore too many times. For example, suppose a semaphore has a maximum count of two, and that thread A and thread B both enter the semaphore. If a programming error in thread B causes it to call Release twice, both calls succeed. The count on the semaphore is full, and when thread A eventually calls Release, a SemaphoreFullException is thrown.
Semaphores are of two types: local semaphores and named system semaphores. If you create a Semaphore object using a constructor that accepts a name, it is associated with an operating-system semaphore of that name. Named system semaphores are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes. You can create multiple Semaphore objects that represent the same named system semaphore, and you can use the OpenExisting method to open an existing named system semaphore.
A local semaphore exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the local Semaphore object. Each Semaphore object is a separate local semaphore.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_15">

<p>synchronization primitive that can also be used for interprocess synchronization. 
</p>
<p>
When two or more threads need to access a shared resource at the same time, the system needs a synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one thread at a time uses the resource. Mutex is a synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to the shared resource to only one thread. If a thread acquires a mutex, the second thread that wants to acquire that mutex is suspended until the first thread releases the mutex.
You can use the WaitHandle.WaitOne method to request ownership of a mutex. The thread that owns a mutex can request the same mutex in repeated calls to WaitOne without blocking its execution. However, the thread must call the ReleaseMutex method the same number of times to release ownership of the mutex. The Mutex class enforces thread identity, so a mutex can be released only by the thread that acquired it. By contrast, the Semaphore class does not enforce thread identity. 
If a thread terminates while owning a mutex, the mutex is said to be abandoned. The state of the mutex is set to signaled, and the next waiting thread gets ownership. Beginning in version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, an AbandonedMutexException is thrown in the next thread that acquires the abandoned mutex. Before version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, no exception was thrown.
</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b> 
An abandoned mutex often indicates a serious error in the code. When a thread exits without releasing the mutex, the data structures protected by the mutex might not be in a consistent state. The next thread to request ownership of the mutex can handle this exception and proceed, if the integrity of the data structures can be verified. 
In the case of a system-wide mutex, an abandoned mutex might indicate that an application has been terminated abruptly (for example, by using Windows Task Manager).
Mutexes are of two types: local mutexes, which are unnamed, and named system mutexes. A local mutex exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the Mutex object that represents the mutex. Each unnamed Mutex object represents a separate local mutex.
Named system mutexes are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes. You can create a Mutex object that represents a named system mutex by using a constructor that accepts a name. The operating-system object can be created at the same time, or it can exist before the creation of the Mutex object. You can create multiple Mutex objects that represent the same named system mutex, and you can use the OpenExisting method to open an existing named system mutex.

<h3 id="sec-2_16"><span class="section-number-3">2.16</span> Monitor </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_16">

<p>The Monitor class controls access to objects by granting a lock for an object to a single thread. Object locks provide the ability to restrict access to a block of code, commonly called a critical section. While a thread owns the lock for an object, no other thread can acquire that lock. You can also use Monitor to ensure that no other thread is allowed to access a section of application code being executed by the lock owner, unless the other thread is executing the code using a different locked object.
</p>
<p>
Note   Use Monitor to lock objects (that is, reference types), not value types. For details, see Enter and the conceptual topic Monitor.
Monitor has the following features: 
</p>
<p>
It is associated with an object on demand.
It is unbound, which means it can be called directly from any context.
An instance of the Monitor class cannot be created.
The following information is maintained for each synchronized object: 
</p>
<p>
A reference to the thread that currently holds the lock.
A reference to a ready queue, which contains the threads that are ready to obtain the lock.
A reference to a waiting queue, which contains the threads that are waiting for notification of a change in the state of the locked object.
The following table describes the actions that can be taken by threads that access synchronized objects:
</p>
<p>
Enter, TryEnter Acquires a lock for an object. This action also marks the beginning of a critical section. No other thread can enter the critical section unless it is executing the instructions in the critical section using a different locked object. 
Wait Releases the lock on an object in order to permit other threads to lock and access the object. The calling thread waits while another thread accesses the object. Pulse signals are used to notify waiting threads about changes to an object's state. 
Pulse (signal), PulseAll Sends a signal to one or more waiting threads. The signal notifies a waiting thread that the state of the locked object has changed, and the owner of the lock is ready to release the lock. The waiting thread is placed in the object's ready queue so that it might eventually receive the lock for the object. Once the thread has the lock, it can check the new state of the object to see if the required state has been reached. 
Exit Releases the lock on an object. This action also marks the end of a critical section protected by the locked object. 
</p>
<p>
Use the Enter and Exit methods to mark the beginning and end of a critical section. If the critical section is a set of contiguous instructions, then the lock acquired by the Enter method guarantees that only a single thread can execute the enclosed code with the locked object. In this case, it is recommended you place those instructions in a try block and place the Exit instruction in a finally block. This facility is typically used to synchronize access to a static or instance method of a class. If an instance method requires synchronized thread access, it invokes the Enter and corresponding Exit methods using the current instance as the object to lock. Since only one thread can hold the lock on the current instance, the method can only be executed by one thread at a time. Static methods are protected in a similar fashion using the Type of the current instance as the locked object. The functionality provided by the Enter and Exit methods is identical to that provided by the C# lock statement.
</p>
<p>
If a critical section spans an entire method, the locking facility described above can be achieved by placing the System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImplAttribute on the method, and specifying the Synchronized value in the constructor of MethodImplAttribute. Using this attribute, the Enter and Exit statements are not needed. Note that the attribute causes the current thread to hold the lock until the method returns; if the lock can be released sooner, use the Monitor class or the C# lock statement instead of the attribute.
</p>
<p>
While it is possible for the Enter and Exit statements that lock and release a given object to cross member or class boundaries or both, this practice is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
When selecting an object on which to synchronize, you should lock only on private or internal objects. Locking on external objects might result in deadlocks, because unrelated code could choose the same objects to lock on for different purposes.
