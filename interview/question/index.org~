** _Object Oriented Design and Architecture_

*** _Access Modifiers_

**** Is private member of an instance accessible with other class with same type ?
#+begin_src csharp
using System;
class cls {
    private int i;
    public int I {
	get { return i;	 } 
	set { i = value; }
    }
    public cls() {}
    public cls (cls right) { 
	i = right.i;	    // No Error: Private member of same type is accessible
    }
}
class program {
    public static void Main () {
	cls a = new cls ();
	a.I = 10;
	cls b = new cls (a);
	Console.WriteLine (b.I);	    
    }
}
#+end_src

*** Static

****  Can static class in C#.NET can inherit from other class ? Can Static class be inherited by other classes ?
ANS)
     * Contains only static members.
     * Cannot be instantiated.
     * Is sealed.
     * Cannot contain Instance Constructors.
     * Static classes are sealed and therefore cannot be inherited. They cannot inherit from any class except Object. Static classes cannot contain an instance constructor; however, they can contain a static constructor. Non-static classes should also define a static constructor if the class contains static members that require non-trivial initialization.

[[../../Books_And_Tutorials/DotNet/Object Cloning or Copying][Reference to chapter from 'Effective C#']]

** _Threading_

*** What are uses of threading ? In Which scenario a thread need to be spawned ?
    1. _Maintaining a responsive user interface_
       By running time-consuming tasks on a parallel “worker” thread, the main UI thread is free to continue processing keyboard and mouse events.
    2. _Making efficient use of an otherwise blocked CPU_
       Multithreading is useful when a thread is awaiting a response from another computer or piece of hardware. While one thread is blocked while performing the task, other threads can take advantage of the otherwise unburdened computer.
    3. _Parallel programming_
       Code that performs intensive calculations can execute faster on multicore or multiprocessor computers if the workload is shared among multiple threads in a “divide-and-conquer” strategy (see Part 5).
    4. _Speculative execution_
       On multicore machines, you can sometimes improve performance by predicting something that might need to be done, and then doing it ahead of time. LINQPad uses this technique to speed up the creation of new queries. A variation is to run a number of different algorithms in parallel that all solve the same task. Whichever one finishes first “wins” — this is effective when you can’t know ahead of time which algorithm will execute fastest.
    5. _Allowing requests to be processed simultaneously_
       On a server, client requests can arrive concurrently and so need to be handled in parallel (the .NET Framework creates threads for this automatically if you use ASP.NET, WCF, Web Services, or Remoting). This can also be useful on a client (e.g., handling peer-to-peer networking — or even multiple requests from the user).

*** _Threading vs Parallel programming._

*** What is Thread Affinity ?

If Interrupt is called on a thread that's not blocked, the thread continues executing until it next blocks, at which point a ThreadInterruptedException is thrown.        |
| Furthermore, the exception will be rethrown at the end of the catch block (in an attempt to terminate the thread for good) unless Thread.ResetAbort is called within the catch block. In the interim, the thread has a ThreadState of AbortRequested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | It is safer to call thread when blocked by checking the ThreadState as followed . /if ((worker.ThreadState & ThreadState.WaitSleepJoin) > 0)  worker.Interrupt();/. But this is not thread-safe because of the possibility of preemption between the if statement and worker.Interrupt. |
| There are two cases, though, where you can safely use Abort. One is if you are willing to tear down a thread's application domain after it is aborted. A good example of when you might do this is in writing a unit-testing framework. Another case where you can call Abort safely is on your own thread (because you know exactly where you are). Aborting your own thread throws an unswallowable exception: one that gets rethrown after each catch block. ASP.NET does exactly this when you call Redirect.                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| The big difference between Interrupt and Abort is what happens when it is called on a thread that is not blocked. Whereas Interrupt waits until the thread next blocks before doing anything, Abort throws an exception on the thread right where it is executing (unmanaged code excepted). This is a problem because .NET Framework code might be aborted  code that is not abort-safe. For example, if an abort occurs while a FileStream is being constructed, it is possible that an unmanaged file handle will remain open until the application domain ends. This rules out using Abort in almost any nontrivial context. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

*** What is weak reference in .Net ?
*Ans:* Weak references are a supplementary mechanism for handling references
to managed objects. The typical object reference (also known as
strong reference) is very deterministic: as long as you have a
reference to the object, the object will stay alive. This is the
correctness promise of the garbage collector.

However, in some scenarios, we would like to keep an invisible string
attached to an object without interfering with the garbage collector's
ability to reclaim that object's memory. If the GC reclaimed the
memory, our string becomes unattached and we can detect this. If the
GC hasn't touched the object yet, we can pull the string and retrieve
a strong reference to the object to use it again.

This facility is useful for various scenarios, of which the following are the most common:
  * Providing an external service without keeping the object
    alive. Services such as timers and events can be provided to
    objects without keeping them referenced, which can solve many typical memory leaks.
  * Automatically managing a cache or pool strategy. A cache can keep
    weak references to the least recently used objects without
    preventing them from being collected; a pool can be partitioned
    into a minimum size which contains strong references and an
    optional size which contains weak references.
  * Keeping a large object alive with the hope that it will not be
    collected. The application can hold a weak reference to a large
    object that took a long time to create and initialize. The object
    might be collected, in which case the application will
    reinitialize it; otherwise, it can be used the next time it is
    needed.

   | *Expensive:* Consumes more time and space: it has to allocate memory on the stack for arguments, return address, and local variables.

   | *Duplicate calculations:* Recursion has more negative impacts on performance if there are duplicated calculations. Recursion is essentially a technique to divide a problem into two or more subproblems. There are duplicated calculations if there are overlaps among subproblems.                                                 | No duplicte calculations.                        |
   | *Stack Overflow:* A more serious problem with recursion other than inefficiency is that it causes errors due to call stack overflows. As mentioned earlier, it consumes some memory on the stack for each recursive call, so it may use up all memory on the stack if recursive levels are very deep, and cause call stack overflow. | No problem of stack overflow.                    |
