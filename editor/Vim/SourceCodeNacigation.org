To jump to the beginning of a C code block (while, switch, if etc), use the [{ command.

To jump to the end of a C code block (while, switch, if etc), use the ]} command.

The above two commands will work from anywhere inside the code block.

To jump to the beginning of a parenthesis use the [( command.

To jump to the end of a parenthesis use the ]) command.

  * :help ])

Comments[yH5BAE]Edit

Related to these motion commands are [[ and ]]

  * [[ : sections backward or to the previous '{' in the first column.
  * ]] : sections forward or to the next '{' in the first column.
  * [] : sections backward or to the previous '}' in the first column.

This has specially help me in jumping to the top of the functions and jumping from one
function to the next function. For instance, the first command takes you to the beginning of
the current function. The second command takes you to the beginning of the next function. The
third takes you to the end of the previous function.

May be our coding convention played a part in this

To jump to the beginning/end of a function that does not have a "{" in the first column,
there is a work around in the Vim documentation. Try ":help [[" and search for "map" in that
text.

What's the different between this and just searching "/ or ?" for the braces?

I thought this might be a smarter search, but "[{" will still match in open curlies inside a
comment.

 /} will not work for nested {}.
