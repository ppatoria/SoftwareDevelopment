* Continuous Integration

A typical CI process works like this:
 1. The developer builds the software on his local PC and then runs unit tests on it.
 2. After the code passes all the unit tests, the source is checked in to a source code repository.
 3. An automated system on the CI Server detects that changes have been made in the repository and gets a copy of the code to its local system.
 4. The CI Server builds the software and then runs unit tests.
 5. The results of the build and unit tests are automatically posted
    to a web site where all team members can see the current state of
    the software.
