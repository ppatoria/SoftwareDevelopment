<h1>UML Association</h1>

<p>
<strong>Association</strong> is
 a <a href="uml-core.html#relationship" class="ref-link">relationship</a>
 between <a href="classifier.html" class="ref-link">classifiers</a>
which is used to show that instances of classifiers could be
 either <a href="association.html#link" class="ref-link">linked</a> to each other
 or <a href="association.html#aggregation" class="ref-link">combined</a>
 logically or physically into some aggregation.
</p>

<p>
UML specification categorizes association as 
 <a href="uml-core.html#semantic-relationship" class="ref-link">semantic relationship</a>.
 Some other UML sources also categorize association as a <strong>structural relationship</strong>.
Wikipedia states that association is <strong>instance level</strong> relationship and
 that associations can only be shown on <strong>class diagrams</strong>.
 Not sure where they got that information from but it is not based on UML specification.
<a href="association.html" class="ref-link">Association</a>
 could be used on different types of UML 
 <a href="uml-25-diagrams.html#structure-diagram" class="ref-link">structure diagrams</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="class-diagrams-overview.html" class="ref-link">class diagram associations</a>,</li>
<li><a href="use-case-actor-association.html" class="ref-link">use case diagram associations</a>,</li>
<li><a href="deployment-diagrams.html#artifact-association" class="ref-link">deployment diagram artifact associations</a>,</li>
<li><a href="deployment-diagrams.html#communication-path" class="ref-link">deployment diagram communication path</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are several concepts related to association:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="association.html#association-end" class="ref-link">association end ownership</a>,</li>
<li><a href="association.html#navigability" class="ref-link">navigability</a>,</li>
<li><a href="association.html#arity" class="ref-link">association arity</a>,</li>
<li><a href="association.html#aggregation" class="ref-link">aggregation type</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="references.html#ref-uml-24-super" class="external-ref" title="UML 2.4 - Superstructure">UML 2.4 specification</a>
 states that for the association:
"<span class="citation">Aggregation type, navigability, and end ownership are orthogonal concepts, ...</span>"
which is clearly an overstatement. Orthogonal usually means completely independent. While notation for
 <a href="association.html#aggregation" class="ref-link">aggregation type</a>,
 <a href="association.html#navigability" class="ref-link">navigability</a>, and
 <a href="association.html#association-end" class="ref-link">association end ownership</a>
 could be applied independently, the concepts themselves are not orthogonal.
 For example, in UML 2.4 end property of association owned by an end class is navigable,
 which clearly makes navigability dependent on ownership.
</p>

<p class="figure-text">

</p>
</div>

<p>
An association is usually drawn as a solid line connecting two classifiers or a single
 classifier to itself. 
 Name of the association can be shown somewhere near the middle of the association line but not too close
 to any of the ends of the line.
 Each end of the line could be decorated  with the name of the
<a href="association.html#association-end" class="ref-link">association end</a>.

  Association End 
**********************
-->

<h2 id="association-end">Association End</h2>

<p>
<strong>Association end</strong> is a connection between the line depicting
 an <a href="association.html" class="ref-link">association</a>
 and the icon depicting the connected
 <a href="classifier.html" class="ref-link">classifier</a>.
 Name of the association end may be placed near the end of the line.
 The association end name is commonly referred to as <strong>role</strong> name
 (but it is not defined as such in the UML 2.4 standard).
 The role name is optional and suppressible.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">
<img src="association/association.png" width="330" height="52"
 alt="Professor playing the role of author associated with textbook end typed as Book."
 title="Professor playing the role of author associated with textbook end typed as Book." />
<p class="figure-text">
<strong>Professor</strong> "playing the role" of <strong>author</strong> is associated<br />
 with <strong>textbook</strong> end typed as <strong>Book</strong>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The idea of the <strong>role</strong> is that the same classifier can play the same or different roles
 in other associations. For example, Professor could be an author of some Books or an editor.
</p>

<p>
Association end could be <strong>owned</strong> either by
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>end classifier</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>association</strong> itself</li>
</ul>

<p>
Association ends of associations with <strong>more than two ends</strong> must be
 <strong>owned by the association</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Ownership of association ends by an associated <strong>classifier</strong> may be indicated graphically by a
 <strong>small filled circle</strong> (aka <strong>dot</strong>).
  The dot is drawn at the point where line meets the classifier.
It could be interpreted as showing that the model includes a property of the type
 represented by the classifier touched by the dot.
  This property is owned by the classifier <strong>at the other end</strong>.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">
<img src="association/class-association-ownership.png" width="290" height="50"
 alt="Ownership of association ends by association and classifier"
 title="Ownership of association ends by association and classifier" />
<p class="figure-text">
Association end <strong>query</strong> is owned by classifier <strong>QueryBuilder</strong><br /> 
and association end <strong>qbuilder</strong> is owned by association <strong>Builds</strong> itself
</p>
</div>

<p>
The "ownership" dot may be used in combination with the other graphic line-path notations
 for properties of associations and association ends. These include aggregation type and navigability.
</p>

<p>
UML standard does not mandate the use of explicit end-ownership notation,
 but defines a notation which shall apply in models where such use is elected.
 The dot notation must be applied at the level of complete associations or higher, so that
the <strong>absence of the dot signifies ownership by the association</strong>.
 In other words, in binary associations the dot will be omitted only for the ends
  which are <strong>not owned by a classifier</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Attribute notation can be used for an association end <strong>owned by a class</strong>, because an association
end owned by a class is also an <strong>attribute</strong>.
 This notation may be used in conjunction with the line arrow notation to make
it perfectly clear that the attribute is also an <strong>association end</strong>.

<!--
****************************
  Association Navigability
**************************** 
-->

<h2 id="navigability">Navigability</h2>

<p>
End property of association is <strong>navigable</strong> from the opposite end(s) of association
if instances of the classifier at this end
of the <a href="association.html#link" class="ref-link">link</a>
 can be accessed efficiently at runtime from instances at the other ends of the link.
</p>

<p>
UML specification does not dictate how efficient this access should be or any specific mechanism
 to achieve the efficiency. It is implementation specific.
</p>

<p>
When end property of association is marked as <strong>not navigable</strong>, in
<a href="references.html#ref-uml-24-super" class="external-ref" title="UML 2.4 - Superstructure">[UML 2.4]</a>
it means that
<span class="citation">"access from the other ends may or may not be possible, and if it is,
it might not be efficient."</span>
The problem with this definition of <strong>not navigable</strong> is that it actually means "whatever"
 or "who cares?" navigability.
</p>

<p>
<strong>UML 2.4</strong> also provides another definition of <strong>navigability</strong>:
</p>

<p class="citation">An end property of association that is owned by an end class, or that is
a navigable owned end of the association indicates that
the association is <strong>navigable</strong> from the opposite ends;
otherwise, the association is <strong>not navigable</strong> from the opposite ends.
</p>

<p>
This definition is odd because it makes <strong>navigability</strong> strongly dependent on <strong>ownership</strong>,
while these are assumed to be <strong>orthogonal</strong> concepts;
some examples in UML 2.4 specs show end properties owned by a class as <strong>not navigable</strong>,
which contradicts to the definition above;
and navigability is defined using "<strong>navigable</strong> owned end of the association".
</p>


<p>
<strong>Deprecated navigability convention:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>non-navigable ends were assumed to be owned by the association
</li>
<li>navigable ends were assumed to be owned by the classifier at the opposite end. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Notation:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>navigable</strong> end is indicated by an <strong>open arrowhead</strong> on the end of an association</li>
<li><strong>not navigable</strong> end is indicated with a <strong>small x</strong> on the end of an association</li>
<li>no adornment on the end of an association means <strong>unspecified navigability</strong>

A <strong>visibility</strong> symbol can be added as an adornment on a navigable end to show the end’s
visibility as an attribute of the featuring classifier.

   Association Arity
*************************
-->

<h2 id="arity">Arity</h2>

<p>
Each association has specific <strong>arity</strong> as it could relate two or more items.
</p>

<h4 id="binary-association">Binary Association</h4>

<p>
<strong>Binary association</strong> relates <strong>two</strong> typed instances.
It is normally rendered as a solid line connecting two classifiers,
 or a solid line connecting a single classifier to itself (the two ends are distinct).
  The line may consist of one or more connected segments.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">

</p>
</div>

<p>
 A small solid triangle could be placed next to or in place of the name of <strong>binary association</strong>
 (drawn as a solid line) to show the <strong>order of the ends</strong> of the association.
 The arrow points along the line
  in the direction of <strong>the last end</strong> in the order of the association ends.
 This notation also indicates that the association is to be <strong>read</strong> from the first end to the last end.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">

<p class="figure-text">

<p>
UML 2.4 specification states that this arrow is used <strong>for documentation purposes only</strong>
and <strong>has no general semantic interpretation</strong>.
This is an odd clarification as UML diagrams are in fact used mostly for documentation purposes but
even more important, this arrow according to the UML spec defines the <strong>order</strong> 
of association ends - which does belong to semantics.
</p>

<h4 id="nary-association">N-ary Association</h4>

<p>
Any association may be drawn as a <strong>diamond</strong> (larger than a terminator on a line)
 with a solid line for each association end connecting the diamond to the classifier
 that is the end’s type. <strong>N-ary association</strong> with more than two ends
 can <strong>only</strong> be drawn this way.

   Association Aggregation
******************************
-->

<h2 id="aggregation">Shared and Composite Aggregation</h2>

<p>
<strong>Aggregation</strong> is
 a <a href="association.html#binary-association" class="ref-link">binary association</a>
 representing some <strong>whole/part relationship</strong>. Aggregation type could be either:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="association.html#shared-aggregation" class="ref-link">shared aggregation</a> (aka <strong>aggregation</strong>), or</li>
<li><a href="association.html#composition" class="ref-link">composite aggregation</a> (aka <strong>composition</strong>).</li>
</ul>


<!--
***************************
   Shared Aggregation
***************************
-->

<h3 id="shared-aggregation">Aggregation</h3>

<p>
<strong>Aggregation</strong> (<strong>shared aggregation</strong>) is a "weak" form
 of <a href="association.html#aggregation" class="ref-link">aggregation</a>
  when part instance is independent of the composite:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the same (shared) part could be included in several composites, and</li>
<li>if composite is deleted, shared parts may still exist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shared aggregation is shown as binary association decorated with a <strong>hollow diamond</strong> as
a terminal adornment at the aggregate end of the association line.
 The diamond should be noticeably smaller than the diamond notation for N-ary associations.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">

<!--
*********************
   Composition
*********************
-->

<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>

<p>
<strong>Composition</strong> (<strong>composite aggregation</strong>) is a "strong" form
 of <a href="association.html#aggregation" class="ref-link">aggregation</a>.
Composition requirements/features listed in UML specification are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it is a <strong>whole/part relationship</strong>,</li>
<li>it is <a href="association.html#binary-association" class="ref-link">binary association</a>,</li>
<li>part could be included in <strong>at most one</strong> composite (whole) at a time, and</li>
<li>if a composite (whole) is deleted, all of its composite parts are "normally" deleted with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note, that UML does not define how, when and specific order in which parts of the composite are created.
Also, in some cases a part can be removed from a composite before the composite is deleted,
and so is not necessarily deleted as part of the composite.
</p>

<p>
Composite aggregation is depicted as a binary association decorated with a <strong>filled black diamond</strong>
 at the aggregate (whole) end.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">
<img src="association/class-composition.png" width="270" height="51"
 alt="Composite aggregation is depicted as binary associations with filled black diamond"

<p class="figure-text">
Folder could contain many files, while each File has exactly one Folder parent.<br />
If Folder is deleted, all contained Files are deleted as well.
</p>
</div>

<p>
When composition is used in <strong>domain models</strong>, both whole/part relationship as well 
as event of composite "deletion" should be interpreted figuratively,
not necessarily as physical containment and/or termination.
UML specification needs to be updated to explicitly allow this interpretation.
</p>

each Department belongs to exactly one Hospital.<br />
If Hospital is closed, so are all of its Departments.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note, that though it seems odd, multiplicity of the composite (whole) could be specified as
<strong>0..1</strong> ("at most one") which means that part is allowed to be a "stand alone",
 not owned by any specific composite.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">

 Association Class
*******************
-->

<h2>Association Class</h2>

<p>
An association may be refined to have its <strong>own set of features</strong>;
 that is, features that do not belong to any of the connected
classifiers but rather to the association itself.
 Such an association is called an <strong>association class</strong>.
  It is both an association, connecting a set of classifiers and a class,
 and as such could have features and might be included in other associations.
</p>

<p>
 An association class can be seen as an association that
also has class properties, or as a class that also has association properties.
</p>

<p>
An association class is shown as a class symbol attached to the association path by a dashed line.
 The association path and the association class symbol represent the same underlying model element,
 which has a single name. The association name may
be placed on the path, in the class symbol, or on both, but they must be the same name.
</p>

       Link
******************

<h2 id="link">Link</h2>

<p>
<strong>Link</strong> is an instance of
 an <a href="association.html" class="ref-link">association</a>.
 It is a tuple with one value for the each end of the association,
 where each value is an instance of the type of the end.
 Association has at least two ends, represented by properties (<strong>end properties</strong>).
</p>

<p>
Link is rendered using the same notation as for an association.
 Solid line connects <a href="uml-core.html#instance-core" class="ref-link">instances</a>
 rather than classifiers.
 Name of the link could be shown underlined though it is not required.
 End names (<a href="association.html#association-end" class="ref-link">roles</a>)
